Transportation in Animals
and Plants

Y

ou have learnt earlier that all
organisms need food, water and
oxygen for survival. They need to
transport all these to various parts of
their body. Further, animals need to
transport wastes to parts from where
they can be removed. Have you
wondered how all this is achieved? Look
at Fig. 11.1. Do you see the heart and
the blood vessels? They function to
transport substances and together form
the circulatory system. In this chapter
you shall learn about transport of
substances in plants and animals.

11.1 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Blood
What happens when you get a cut on
your body? Blood flows out. But what
is blood? Blood is the fluid which
flows in blood vessels. It transports
substances like digested food from the
small intestine to the other parts of the
body. It carries oxygen from the lungs
to the cells of the body. It also transports
waste for removal from the body.
How does the blood carry various
substances? Blood is a liquid, which has
cells of various kinds suspended in it.
Why is the colour of
blood red ?

Fig. 11.1 Circulatory system
(Arteries are shown in red colour and vein in blue)

The fluid part of the blood is called
plasma.
One type of cells are the red blood
cells (RBC) which contain a red pigment
called haemoglobin. Haemoglobin
binds with oxygen and transports it to
all the parts of the body and ultimately
to all the cells. It will be difficult to
provide oxygen efficiently to all the cells
of the body without haemoglobin. The
presence of haemoglobin makes blood
appear red.
The blood also has white blood cells
(WBC) which fight against germs that
may enter our body.
Boojho fell down while playing a
game and his knee got injured. Blood
was coming out from the cut. After some
time, he noticed that bleeding had
stopped and a dark red clot had plugged
the cut. Boojho was puzzled about this.
The clot is formed because of the
presence of another type of cells in the
blood, called platelets.

Blood vessels
There are different types of blood vessels
in the body. You know that during
inhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fills
the lungs. Oxygen has to be transported
to the rest of the body.
Also, the blood picks up the waste
materials including carbon dioxide from
the cells. This blood has to go back to
the heart for transport to the lungs for
removal of carbon dioxide as you have
learnt in Chapter 10. So, two types of
blood vessels, arteries and veins are
present in the body. (Fig. 11.1)
122

Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood
from the heart to all parts of the body.
Since the blood flow is rapid and at a
high pressure, the arteries have thick
elastic walls.
Let us perform an activity to study
the flow of blood through arteries.

Activity 11.1
Place the middle and index finger of
your right hand on the inner side of your
left wrist (Fig. 11.2). Can you feel some
throbbing movements? Why do you
think there is throbbing? This
throbbing is called the pulse and it is
due to the blood flowing in the arteries.
Count the number of pulse beats in one
minute.
How many pulse beats could you
count? The number of beats per minute
is called the pulse rate. A resting
person, usually has a pulse rate between
72 and 80 beats per minute. Find other
places in your body where you can feel
the pulse.
Record your own pulse beats per
minute and those of your classmates.

Veins are the vessels which carry
carbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts
of the body back to the heart. The veins
have thin walls. There are valves present
in veins which allow blood to flow only
towards the heart.

I am confused! I have learnt
that an artery always
carries oxygen-rich blood.
Paheli explained that the
pulmonary artery carries blood
from the heart, so it is called an
artery and not a vein. It carries
carbon dioxide-rich blood to the
lungs. Pulmonary vein carries
oxygen-rich blood from the
lungs to the heart.

Refer to Fig. 11.3. Do you see the
arteries divide into smaller vessels. On
reaching the tissues, they divide further
into extremely thin tubes called
capillaries. The capillaries join up to
form veins which empty into the heart.

TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS

The heart is an organ which beats
continuously to act as a pump for the
transport of blood, which carries other
substances with it.
Imagine a pump working for
years without stopping! Absolutely
impossible. Yet our heart works like a
pump non-stop. Let us now learn about
the heart.
The heart is located in the chest
cavity with its lower tip slightly tilted
towards the left (Fig. 11.1). Hold your
fingers inwards on your palm. That
123

makes your fist. Your heart is roughly
the size of your fist.
What will happen if the blood rich in
oxygen and the blood rich in carbon
dioxide mix with each other? To avoid
this from happening, the heart has four

chambers. The two upper chambers are
called the atria (singular: atrium) and
the two lower chambers are called the
ventricles (Fig. 11.4). The partition
between the chambers helps to avoid

the blood rich in carbon dioxide.
To understand the functioning of the
circulatory system, start from the right
side of the heart in Fig. 11.3 and follow
the arrows. These arrows show the
direction of the blood flow from the heart
SCIENCE

to the lungs and back to the heart from
where it is pumped to the rest of the
body.

Heartbeat
The walls of the chambers of the heart
are made up of muscles. These muscles
contract and relax rhythmically. This
rhythmic contraction followed by its
relaxation constitute a heartbeat.
Remember that heartbeats continue
every moment of our life. If you place
your hand on the left side of your chest,
you can feel your heartbeat. The doctor
feels your heartbeats with the help of
an instrument called a stethoscope.
A doctor uses the stethoscope as a
device to amplify the sound of the heart.
It consists of a chest piece that carries a
sensitive diaphragm, two ear pieces and
a tube joining the parts. Doctors can
get clues about the condition of your

heart by listening through a
stethoscope.
Let us construct a model of a
stethoscope with the materials that are
available around us.

Activity 11.2
Take a small funnel of 6 ñ7 cm in
diameter. Fix a rubber tube (50 cm long)
tightly on the stem of the funnel. Stretch
a rubber sheet (or a balloon) on the
mouth of the funnel and fix it tightly
with a rubber band. Put the open end
of the tube on one of your ears. Place

the mouth of the funnel on your chest
near the heart. Now try to listen
carefully. Do you hear a regular
thumping sound ? The sound is that of
heart beats. How many times did your
heart beat in a minute ? Count again
after running for 4ñ5 minutes. Compare
your observations.
Record your own pulse rate and heart
beat and that of your friends while
resting and after running and record in
Table 11.2. Do you find any relationship
between your heart beat and pulse rate?
Each heart beat generates one pulse in
the arteries and the pulse rate per
minute indicates the rate of heart beat.
The rhythmic beating of the various
chambers of the heart maintain
circulation of blood and transport of
substances to the different parts of the
body.
Boojho wonders if sponges and
hydra also have blood? Animals such
as sponges and Hydra do not posses any
circulatory system. The water in which
they live brings food and oxygen as it
The English physician, William Harvey
(A.D.1578 ñ1657), discovered the
circulation of blood. The current
opinion in those days was that blood
oscillates in the vessels of the body.
For his views, Harvey was ridiculed
and was called ìcirculatorî. He lost
most of his patients. However, before
he died, Harveyís idea about
circulation was generally accepted as
a biological fact.
126

enters their bodies. The water carries
away waste materials and carbon dioxide
as it moves out. Thus, these animals do
not need a circulatory fluid like the
blood.
Let us now learn about the removal
of waste other than carbon dioxide.

11.2 EXCRETION

IN

ANIMALS

Recall how carbon dioxide is removed
as waste from the body through the
lungs during exhalation. Also recall that
the undigested food is removed during
egestion. Let us now find out how the
other waste materials are removed from
the body. You may wonder where these
unwanted materials come from!
When our cells per for m their
functions, certain waste products are
released. These are toxic and hence need
to be removed from the body. The
process of removal of wastes produced
in the cells of the living organisms is
called excretion. The parts involved in
excretion forms the excretory system.

Excretory system in humans
The waste which is present in the blood
has to be removed from the body. How
can this be done? A mechanism to filter
the blood is required. This is done by
the blood capillaries in the kidneys.
When the blood reaches the two kidneys,
it contains both useful and harmful
substances. The useful substances are
absorbed back into the blood. The
wastes dissolved in water are removed
as urine. From the kidneys, the urine
goes into the urinary bladder through

contains water and salts. Boojho has
seen that sometimes in summer, white
patches are formed on our clothes,
especially in areas like underarms.
These marks are left by salts present in
the sweat.
Does sweat serve any other function?
We know that the water kept in an
earthen pot (matka) is cooler. This is
because the water evaporates from the
pores of the pot, which causes cooling.

Paheli wants to know
whether other animals also
urinate?

tube-like ureters. It is stored in the
bladder and is passed out through the
urinary opening at the end of a
muscular tube called urethra (Fig. 11.6).
The kindeys, ureters, bladder and
urethra form the excretory system.
An adult human being normally
passes about 1ñ1.8 L of urine in 24
hours. The urine consists of 95% water,
2.5% urea and 2.5% other waste
products.
We have all experienced that we sweat
on a hot summer day. The sweat
TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS

The way in which waste chemicals
are removed from the body of the
animal depends on the availability
of water. Aquatic animals like fishes,
excrete cell waste as ammonia which
directly dissolves in water. Some
land animals like birds, lizards,
snakes excrete a semi-solid, white
coloured compound (uric acid). The
major excretory product in humans
is urea.
Sometimes a personís kidneys may
stop working due to infection or
injury. As a result of kidney failure,
waste products start accumulating in
the blood. Such persons cannot
survive unless their blood is filtered
periodically through an artificial
kidney. This process is called dialysis.
127

Similarly, when we sweat, it helps to cool
our body.

11.3 TRANSPORT

OF

SUBSTANCES

IN

In Chapter 1 you learnt that plants take
water and mineral nutrients from the soil
through the roots and transport it to the
leaves. The leaves prepare food for the
plant, using water and carbon dioxide
during photosynthesis. You also learnt in
Chapter 10 that food is the source of
energy and every cell of an organism gets
energy by the breakdown of glucose. The
cells use this energy to carry out vital
activities of life. Therefore food must be
made available to every cell of an
organism. Have you ever wondered how
water and nutrients absorbed by the
root are transported to the leaves? How
is the food prepared by the leaves carried
to the parts which cannot make food?

The root hair increase the surface area
of the root for the absorption of water
and mineral nutrients dissolved in
water. The root hair is in contact with
the water present between the soil
particles [Fig. 11.7 (a)].
Can you guess how water moves
from the root to the leaves? What kind
of transport system is present in plants?
Boojho thinks that plants
may have pipes to transport
water to the entire plant like
we have in our homes for the
supply of water.

Transport of water and
minerals
Plants absorb water and minerals by
the roots. The roots have root hair.

SCIENCE

Well, Boojho is right. Plants have
pipe-like vessels to transport water and
nutrients from the soil. The vessels are
made of special cells, forming the
vascular tissue. A tissue is a group of
cells that perform specialised function
in an organism. The vascular tissue for
the transport of water and nutrients in the
plant is called the xylem [Fig. 11.7 (a)].
The xylem forms a continuous
network of channels that connects roots
to the leaves through the stem and
branches and thus transports water to
the entire plant [Fig. 11.7 (b)].

Paheli says her mother puts
ladyfinger and other vegetables in
water if they are somewhat dry.
She wants to know how water
enters into them.

is below the level of the pin. Allow the
apparatus to stand for a few hours.
You would find an increase in the
level of sugar solution. How did water
get inside the potato? For very short
distances water can move from one cell
to another. In the same way water
reaches xylem vessels of the root from
the soil [Fig. 11.7 (a)].

Transpiration
You know that leaves synthesise
food. The food has to be transported to
all parts of the plant. This is done by
the vascular tissue called the phloem.
Thus, xylem and phloem transport
substances in plants.

Activity 11.3
Take a large potato and peel off its outer
skin. Cut one of its ends to make the
base flat. Now make a deep and hollow
cavity on the opposite side. Fill half of
the cavity with sugar solution and mark
the level by inserting a pin in the wall
of the potato (Fig. 11.8). Put the potato
TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS

In Class VI you learnt that plants release
a lot of water by the process of
transpiration.
Plants absorb mineral nutrients and
water from the soil. Not all the water
absorbed is utilised by the plant. The
water evaporates through the stomata
present on the surface of the leaves by

plants absorb a large quantity
of water from the soil, then give
it off by transpiration!

129

the process of transpiration. The
evaporation of water from leaves
generates a suction pull (the same
that you produce when you suck

water through a straw) which can
pull water to great heights in the
tall trees. Transpiration also cools
the plant.

What you have learnt
In most animals the blood that circulates in the body distributes food
and oxygen to different cells of the body. It also carries waste products to
different parts of the body for excretion.
Circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels.
In humans, blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart acts
as a pumping organ.
Blood consists of plasma, RBC, WBC and platelets. Blood is red due to
the presence of a red pigment, haemoglobin.
The human heart beats about 70ñ80 times per minute in an adult
person. This is called heart rate.
Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body.
Veins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.
Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion.
Excretory system of humans consists of two kidneys, two ureters, a
urinary bladder, and urethra.
Salts and urea are removed along with water as sweat.

130

SCIENCE

Fish excrete waste substances such as ammonia which directly dissolve
in water.
Birds, insects and lizard excrete uric acid in semi-solid form.
Water and mineral nutrients are absorbed by roots from the soil.
Nutrients are transported along with water to the entire plant via the
vascular tissue called xylem.
The vascular tissue for the transport of food to the various parts of the
plant is phloem.
A lot of water is lost by plants in the form of vapour through stomata
during transpiration.
Transpiration generates a force which pulls up water absorbed by the
roots from the soil, to reach the stem and leaves.

Did you know?
There is no substitute for blood. If people lose blood from surgery or injury
or if their bodies cannot produce enough blood, there is only one way to
get it ó through transfusion of blood donated by volunteers. Blood is
usually in short supply. Donating blood does not decrease the strength of
the donors.
