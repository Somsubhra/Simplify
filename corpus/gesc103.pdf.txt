Fibre to Fabric

I

Like us, the hairy skin of the sheep
has two types of fibres that form its
fleece: (i) the coarse beard hair, and
(ii) the fine soft under-hair close to the
skin. The fine hair provide the fibres for
making wool. Some breeds of sheep
possess only fine under -hair. Their
parents are specially chosen to give birth
to sheep which have only soft underhair. This process of selecting parents
for obtaining special characters in their
offspring, such as soft under hair in
sheep, is termed ‘selective breeding’.

n Class VI you have learnt about
some fibres obtained from plants.
You also learnt that wool and silk
fibres are obtained from animals. Wool
is obtained from the fleece (hair) of
sheep or yak. Silk fibres come from
cocoons of the silk moth. Do you know
which part of the sheep’s body yields
fibres? Are you aware how these fibres
are converted into the woollen yarn that
we buy from the market to knit sweaters?
Do you have any idea how silk fibres are
made into silk, which is woven into saris?
In this Chapter we shall try to find
answers to these questions.

Wool comes from sheep, goat, yak and
some other animals. These wool-yielding
animals bear hair on their body. Do you
know why these animals have a thick
coat of hair? Hair trap a lot of air. Air is
a poor conductor of heat, as you would
learn in Chapter 4. So, hair keeps these
animals warm. Wool is derived from
these hairy fibres.

Activity 3.1

Feel the hair on your body and arms
and those on your head. Do you find
any difference? Which one seems coarse
and which one is soft?

sheep wool (Fig. 3.1). Yak (Fig. 3.2) wool
is common in Tibet and Ladakh. Angora
wool is obtained from angora goats,
(Fig. 3.3) found in hilly regions such as
Jammu and Kashmir.
Wool is also obtained from goat hair
(Fig. 3.4). The under fur of Kashmiri
goat is soft. It is woven into fine shawls
called Pashmina shawls.
The fur (hair) on the body of camels
is also used as wool (Fig. 3.5). Llama
and Alpaca, found in South America,
also yield wool (Fig. 3.6 and 3.7).

For obtaining wool, sheep are reared.
Their hair is cut and processed into
wool. Let us learn about this process.

Processing fibres into wool
The wool which is used for knitting
sweaters or for weaving shawls is the
finished product of a long process,
which involves the following steps:

Rearing and breeding of sheep: If you
travel to the hills in Jammu & Kashmir,
Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal,
Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, or the
plains of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan
and Gujarat, you can see shepherds
taking their herds of sheep for grazing.
Sheep are herbivores and prefer grass
and leaves. Apart from grazing sheep,
rearers also feed them on a mixture of
pulses, corn, jowar, oil cakes (material
left after taking out oil from seeds) and
minerals. In winter, sheep are kept
indoors and fed on leaves, grain and dry
fodder.
Sheep are reared in many parts of
our country for wool. Table 3.1 gives the
names of some breeds of sheep reared
in our country for producing wool. The
quality and texture of the fibres obtained
from them is also indicated in the table.
Certain breeds of sheep have thick
coat of hair on their body which yields
good quality wool in large quantities. As

mentioned earlier, these sheep are
“selectively bred” with one parent being
a sheep of good breed.
Once the reared sheep have
developed a thick growth of hair, hair is
shaved off for getting wool.

ed

From fibres to wool

Step I: The fleece of the sheep along with a
thin layer of skin is removed from its
body [Fig. 3.8 (a)]. This process is called
shearing. Machines similar to those used
by barbers are used to shave off hair.
Usually, hair are removed during the hot
weather. This enables sheep to survive
without their protective coat of hair. The
hair provide woollen fibres. Woollen
fibres are then processed to obtain
woollen yarn. Shearing does not hurt
the sheep just as it does not hurt when
you get a hair cut or your father shaves his
beard. Do you know why? The uppermost
layer of the skin is dead. Also, the hair of
sheep grow again just as your hair does.

Step III: After scouring, sorting is done.
The hairy skin is sent to a factory where
hair of different textures are separated
or sorted.

Step V: The fibres can be dyed in various
colours, as the natural fleece of sheep
and goats is black, brown or white.
Step VI: The fibres are straightened,
combed and rolled into yarn
[Fig. 3.8 (d)]. The longer fibres are
made into wool for sweaters and the
shorter fibres are spun and woven
into woollen cloth.

Step IV: The small fluffy fibres, called
burrs, are picked out from the hair.
These are the same burrs which

sometimes appear on your sweaters. The
fibres are scoured again and dried. This
is the wool ready to be drawn into fibres.

ed

Step II: The sheared skin with hair is
thoroughly washed in tanks to remove
grease, dust and dirt. This is called
scouring. Nowadays scouring is done
by machines [Fig. 3.8 (b) and (c)].

Life history of silk moth
The female silk moth lays eggs, from
which hatch larvae which are called
caterpillars or silkworms. They grow in
size and when the caterpillar is ready to
enter the next stage of its life history
called pupa, it first weaves a net to hold
itself. Then it swings its head from side
to side in the form of the figure of eight (8).
During these movements of the head,
the caterpillar secretes fibre made of a

protein which hardens on exposure to
air and becomes silk fibre. Soon the
caterpillar completely covers itself by
silk fibres and turns into pupa. This
covering is known as cocoon. The further
development of the pupa into moth
continues inside the cocoon (Fig. 3.9). Silk
fibres are used for weaving silk cloth. Can
you imagine that the soft silk yarn is as
strong as a comparable thread of steel!
The silk yarn (thread) is obtained
from the cocoon of the silk moth. There
is a variety of silk moths which look very
different from one another and the silk
yarn they yield is different in texture
(coarse, smooth, shiny, etc.). Thus,
tassar silk, mooga silk, kosa silk, etc.,
are obtained from cocoons spun by
different types of moths. The most
common silk moth is the mulberry silk
moth. The silk fibre from the cocoon of
this moth is soft, lustrous and elastic
and can be dyed in beautiful colours.
Sericulture or culture of silkworms
is a very old occupation in India. India
produces plenty of silk on a commercial
scale.

In India, women are significantly involved in various kinds of industries related
to silk production. These are rearing of silkworms, reeling of silk from cocoons
and processing of raw silk into fabrics. By their enterprise, they contribute to
the nation’s economy. China leads the world in silk production. India also ranks
among the leading silk producing countries.

Rearing silkworms: A female silk moth
lays hundreds of eggs at a time
[Fig. 3.10 (a)]. The eggs are stored
carefully on strips of cloth or paper and
sold to silkworm farmers. The farmers

keep eggs under hygienic conditions
and under suitable conditions of
temperature and humidity.
The eggs are warmed to a suitable
temperature for the larvae to hatch from
eggs. This is done when mulberry trees
[Fig. 3.10 (b)] bear a fresh crop of leaves.
The larvae, called caterpillars or
silkworms, eat day and night and
increase enormously in size [Fig. 3.10 (c)].

The exact time of discovery of silk is perhaps unknown. According to an old
Chinese legend, the empress Si-lung-Chi was asked by the emperor Huang-ti to
find the cause of the damaged leaves of mulberry trees growing in their garden.
The empress found white worms eating up mulberry leaves. She also noticed
that they were spinning shiny cocoons around them. Accidentally a cocoon
dropped into her cup of tea and a tangle of delicate threads separated from the
cocoon. Silk industry began in China and was kept a closely guarded secret for
hundreds of years. Later on, traders and travellers introduced silk to other
countries. The route they travelled is still called the ‘silk route’.

threads from the cocoon for use as silk
is called reeling the silk. Reeling is done
in special machines, which unwind
the threads or fibres of silk from the
cocoon. Silk fibres are then spun into
silk threads, which are woven into silk
cloth by weavers.

The larvae are kept in clean bamboo

the caterpillars stop eating and
move to a tiny chamber of bamboo in
the tray to spin cocoons [Fig. 3.10 (d)].
Small racks or twigs may be provided
in the trays to which cocoons get
attached. The caterpillar or silkworm
spins the cocoon inside which develops
