various purposes at home, in
industry and for running
automobiles. Can you name a few fuels
used in our homes? Name a few fuels
used in trade and industry. What fuels
are used for running automobiles? Your
list will contain fuels like cowdung,
wood, coal, charcoal, petrol, diesel,
compressed natural gas (CNG), etc.
You are familiar with the burning of a
candle. What is the difference between the
burning of a candle and the burning of a
fuel like coal? May be you were able to
guess right: candle burns with a flame
whereas coal does not. Similarly, you will
find many other materials burning
without a flame. Let us study the chemical
process of burning and the types of flame
produced during this process.

6.1 What is Combustion?

Recall the activity of burning of
magnesium ribbon performed in Class
VII. We learnt that magnesium burns to
form magnesium oxide and produces
heat and light (Fig. 6.1).
We can perform a similar activity with
a piece of charcoal. Hold the piece with
a pair of tongs and bring it near the
flame of a candle or a Bunsen burner.
What do you observe?
We find that charcoal burns in air.
We know that coal, too, burns in air
producing carbon dioxide, heat and
light.

Fig. 6.1 : Burning of magnesium

A chemical process in which a
substance reacts with oxygen to give off
heat is called combustion. The
substance that undergoes combustion
is said to be combustible. It is also called
a fuel. The fuel may be solid, liquid or
gas. Sometimes, light is also given off
during combustion, either as a flame or
as a glow.
In the reactions mentioned above
magnesium and charcoal are
combustible substances.

We were told that
food is a fuel for
our body.

Activity 6.2
Rightly so. In our body
food is broken down by
reaction with oxygen and
heat is produced. We
learnt that in Class VII.

unaffected? Can you infer anything
at all about the role played by air in
the process of burning?

We find that for combustion, air is
necessary. The candle burns freely in
case (a) when air can enter the
chimney from below. In case (b), when
air does not enter the chimney from
below, the flame flickers and produces
smoke. In case (c), the flame finally
goes off because the air is not

We have read that the sun

In the sun, heat and light are
produced by nuclear reactions. You
will learn about this process in higher
classes.

Now recall some of your experiences.
Does a matchstick burn by itself?
How does it burn?
You must have had an experience of
burning a piece of paper. Does it burn
when a burning matchstick is brought

Can you burn a piece of wood by
bringing a lighted matchstick near it?
Why do you have to use paper or
kerosene oil to start fire in wood or coal?
Have you heard of forest fires?

Do these experiences tell you that
different substances catch fire at
different temperatures?
The lowest temperature at which a
substance catches fire is called its
ignition temperature.
Can you tell now why a matchstick
does not catch fire on its own at room
temperature? Why does the matchstick
start burning on rubbing it on the side
of the matchbox?
The history of the matchstick is very
old. More than five thousand years
ago small pieces of pinewood dipped
in sulphur were used as matches in
ancient Egypt. The modern safety
match was developed only about two
hundred years ago.
A mixture of antimony trisulphide,
potassium chlorate and white
phosphorus with some glue and
starch was applied on the head of a
match made of suitable wood. When
struck against a rough surface, white
phosphorus got ignited due to the heat
of friction. This started the
combustion of the match. However,
white phosphorus proved to be
dangerous both for the workers
involved in the manufacturing of
matches and for the users.
These days the head of the safety
match contains only antimony
trisulphide and potassium chlorate.
The rubbing surface has powdered
glass and a little red phosphorus
(which is much less dangerous).
When the match is struck against the
rubbing
surface,
some
red
phosphorus gets converted into white
phosphorus. This immediately reacts
with potassium chlorate in the
matchstick head to produce enough
heat to ignite antimony trisulphide
and start the combustion.

We find that a combustible substance
cannot catch fire or burn as long as its
temperature is lower than its ignition
temperature. Have you ever seen
cooking oil catching fire when a frying
pan is kept for long on a burning stove?
Kerosene oil and wood do not catch fire
on their own at room temperature. But,
if kerosene oil is heated a little, it will
catches fire. But if wood is heated a
little, it would still not catch fire. Does
it mean that ignition temperature of
kerosene oil is lower than that of wood?
Does it mean that we need to take
special care in storing kerosene oil? The
following activity shows that it is
essential for a substance to reach
ignition temperature to burn.

The most common fire
extinguisher is water. But
water works only when
things like wood and paper
are on fire. If electrical
equipment is on fire, water
may conduct electricity
and harm those trying to
douse the fire. Water is
also not suitable for fires
involving oil and petrol. Do
you recall that water is
heavier than oil? So, it
sinks below the oil, and oil
Fig. 6.7 : Fire extinguisher
keeps burning on top.
For fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like
petrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher. CO 2, being heavier than
oxygen, covers the fire like a blanket. Since the contact between the fuel and
oxygen is cut off, the fire is controlled. The added advantage of CO2 is that in
most cases it does not harm the electrical equipment.
How do we get the supply of carbon dioxide? It can be stored at high pressure
as a liquid in cylinders. In what form is the LPG stored in cylinders? When
released from the cylinder, CO2 expands enormously in volume and cools down.
So, it not only forms a blanket around the fire, it also brings down the
temperature of the fuel. That is why it is an excellent fire extinguisher. Another
way to get CO 2 is to release a lot of dry powder of chemicals like sodium
bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate. Near the fire, these
chemicals give off CO2.

The type of combustion in which a
material suddenly bursts into flames,
without the application of any apparent
cause is called spontaneous
combustion.
Spontaneous combustion of coal dust
has resulted in many disastrous fires
in coal mines. Spontaneous forest
fires are sometimes due to the heat
69

of the sun or due to lightning strike.
However, most forest fires are due to
the carelessness of human beings. It
is important to remember that the
campfires must be completely
extinguished before leaving a forest
after a picnic, or a visit.

Fig. 6.8: Colours of a candle flame and the
flame of a kitchen stove

We generally have fireworks on
festival days. When a cracker is ignited,
a sudden reaction takes place with the
evolution of heat, light and sound. A
large amount of gas formed in the
reaction is liberated. Such a reaction is
called explosion. Explosion can also take
place if pressure is applied on the
cracker.

Observe an LPG flame. Can you tell the
colour of the flame. What is the colour
of a candle flame?
Recall your experience of burning a
magnesium ribbon in Class VII. If you
do not have experience of burning the
remaining items in Table 6.2 you can
do that now.

Burning of Fuels Leads to Harmful
Products

The increasing fuel consumption has
harmful effects on the environment.
1. Carbon fuels like wood, coal,
petroleum release unburnt carbon
particles. These fine particles are
dangerous pollutants causing
respiratory diseases, such as asthma.
For centuries, wood was used as
domestic and industrial fuel. But now
it has been replaced by coal and other
fuels like LPG. In many rural parts of
our country, people still use wood as
a fuel because of its easy availability
and low cost. However, burning of
wood gives a lot of smoke which is
very harmful for human beings. It
causes respiratory problem. Also,
trees provide us with useful
substances which are lost when wood
is used as fuel. Moreover cutting of
trees leads to deforestation which
is quite harmful to the environment,
as you learnt in Class VII.

3. Combustion of most fuels releases
carbon dioxide in the environment.
Increased concentration of carbon
dioxide in the air is believed to cause
global warming.
Global warming is the rise in
temperature of the atmosphere of the
earth. This results, among other
things, in the melting of polar glaciers,
which leads to a rise in the sea level,
causing floods in the coastal areas.
Low lying coastal areas may even be
permanently submerged under water.

4. Burning of coal and diesel releases
sulphur dioxide gas. It is an
extremely suffocating and corrosive
gas. Moreover, petrol engines give off
gaseous oxides of nitrogen. Oxides
of sulphur and nitrogen dissolve in
rain water and form acids. Such rain
is called acid rain. It is very harmful
for crops, buildings and soil. You have
already learnt about it in Class VII.
The use of diesel and petrol as fuels
in automobiles is being replaced by
CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), because
CNG produces the harmful products in
very small amounts. CNG is a cleaner fuel.

The substances which burn in air are called
combustible.
Oxygen (in air) is essential for combustion.
During the process of combustion, heat and
light are given out.
Ignition temperature is the lowest temperature
at which a combustible substance catches
fire.
Inflammable substances have very low
ignition temperature.
Fire can be controlled by removing one or more
requirements essential for producing fire.
Water is commonly used to control fires.
Water cannot be used to control fires involving
electrical equipments or oils.
There are various types of combustions such
as rapid combustion, spontaneous
combustion, explosion, etc.
There are three different zones of a flame dark zone, luminous zone and non-luminous
zone.
An ideal fuel is cheap, readily available, readily
combustible and easy to transport. It has high
calorific value. It does not produce gases or
residues that pollute the environment.
Fuels differ in their efficiency and cost.
Fuel efficiency is expressed in terms of its
calorific value which is expressed in units of
kilojoule per kg.
Unburnt carbon particles in air are dangerous
pollutants causing respiratory problems.
Incomplete combustion of a fuel gives
poisonous carbon monoxide gas.
Increased percentage of carbon dioxide in air
has been linked to global warming.
Oxides of sulphur and nitrogen produced by
the burning of coal, diesel and petrol cause
acid rain which is harmful for crops, buildings
and soil.
