Any polished or a shiny surface can
act as a mirror. What happens when
light falls on a mirror?
You have learnt in Class VI that a
mirror changes the direction of light that
falls on it. This change of direction by a
mirror is called reflection of light. Can
you recall the activity in which you got
the light of a torch reflected from a
mirror? Let us perform a similar activity.

Activity 15.1

Fig. 15.3 Reflection of objects in water

at a lighted candle first through
a straight pipe and then through
a bent pipe (Fig. 15.2). Why was
Boojho not able to see the candle
flame through a bent pipe?
This activity showed that
light travels along straight lines.
How can we change the path
of light? Do you know, what
happens when light falls on a
polished or a shiny surface?

15.2 REFLECTION

OF

Paheli remembers the story of the lion and the
rabbit from the Panchtantra, in which the
rabbit fooled the lion by showing him his
reflection in water (Fig. 15.4).

LIGHT

One way to change the direction
of light is to let it fall on a shiny
surface. For example, a shining
stainless steel plate or a shining
steel spoon can change the
direction of light. The surface of
water can also act like a mirror
and change the path of light.
Have you ever seen the reflection
of trees or buildings in water
(Fig. 15.3)?
LIGHT

Take a torch. Cover its glass with a chart
paper which has three slits as shown in
Fig. 15.5. Spread a sheet of chart paper

image of the slits.
This activity shows how light gets
reflected from a plane mirror.
Let us play around with the images
formed in mirrors and know a little more
about them.

Activity 15.2
CAUTION

Fig. 15.5 Reflection of light from a mirror

on a smooth wooden board. Fix a plane
mirror strip vertically on the chart paper
(Fig. 15.5). Now direct the beam of light
on the mirror from the torch with slits.
Place the torch in such a way that its
light is seen along the chart paper on
the board. Now adjust its position so
that the light from the torch strikes the
plane mirror at an angle (Fig. 15.5).
Does the mirror change the direction
of light that falls on it? Now move the
torch slightly to either side. Do you find
any change in the direction of reflected
light?
Look into the mirror along the
direction of the reflected light. Do you

Paheli wants to know, what
makes things visible to us?
Boojho thinks that objects are
visible only when light reflected
from them reaches our eyes. Do
you agree with him?
176

Handle the lighted candle with care.
It is better if this activity is performed
in the presence of a teacher or an elder
person.
Place a lighted candle in front of a
plane mirror. Try to see the flame of the
candle in the mirror. It appears as if a
similar candle is placed behind the
mirror. The candle, which appears
behind the mirror, is the image of the
candle formed by the mirror (Fig. 15.6).
The candle itself is the object.
Now move the candle to different
positions in front of the mirror. Observe
the image in each case.

Fig. 15.6 Image of a candle in a plane mirror
SCIENCE

Boojho noted in his notebook: Is
it not surprising that my image is
of the same size as me whether
the mirror is small or large?

Was the image upright in each case?
Did the flame appear on top of the candle
as in the object? Such an image is called
erect. An image formed by a plane
mirror is erect and of the same size as
the object.
Now place a vertical screen behind
the mirror. Try to obtain the image of
the candle on this screen. Can you get
the image on the screen? Now place the
screen in front of the mirror. Can you
get the image on the screen now? You
will find that the image of the candle

cannot be obtained on the screen in
either case.
What about the distance of the image
from mirror? Let us perform another
activity.

Activity 15.3
Take a chess board. If a chess board is
not available, draw on a chart paper 64
(8◊8) squares of equal size. Draw a thick
line in the middle of the paper. Fix a
plane mirror vertically on this line. Place
any small object, such as a pencil
sharpner, at the boundary of the third
square counting from the mirror
(Fig. 15.7). Note the position of the
image. Now shift the object to the
boundary of the fourth square. Again
note the position of the image. Did you
find any relation between the distance
of the image from the mirror and that of
the object in front of it?

Fig. 15.7 Locating image in a plane mirror

Paheli made a note in her notebook:
In a plane mirror the image is
formed behind the mirror. It is erect,
of the same size and is at the same
distance from the mirror as the
object is in front of it.

LIGHT

You will find that the image
is at the same distance behind
the mirror as the object is in front
of it. Now verify this by placing
the object anywhere on the chart
paper.

When you see your image in a plane
mirror, is it exactly like you? Have you
ever noticed that there is one interesting
difference between you and your image

Activity 15.4
Stand in front of a plane mirror and look
at your image. Raise your left hand.
Which hand does your image raise
(Fig. 15.8)? Now touch your right ear.
Which ear does your hand touch in your
image? Observe carefully. You will find
that in the mirror the ërightí appears ëleftí
and the ëleftí appears ërightí. Note that
only sides are interchanged; the image
does not appear upside down.

understand
why the word ëAMBULANCEí is written
as in Fig. 15.9 ? When the driver of a
vehicle ahead of an ambulance looks in
her/his rear view mirror, she/he can
read ëAMBULANCEí written on it and
give way to it. It is the duty of every one
of us to allow an ambulance to pass
without blocking its way.
You might have observed that in the
side mirror of a scooter or a car the
images of all the objects appear smaller
than the objects themselves. Have you
ever wondered why it is so?
SCIENCE

15.4 PLAYING WITH SPHERICAL
MIRRORS
Paheli and Boojho were waiting for their
dinner. Boojho lifted a stainless steel
plate and saw his image in it. Oh! This
plate acts as a plane mirror. My image
is erect and is of the same size. Paheli
saw her image using the back of a steel
spoon. ìBoojho look here! I can also see
my erect image though it is smaller in
size. This spoon also acts as a mirror of
some kindî, said Paheli.
You can also use a spoon or any
curved shining surface to see your
image.

Now look at your image using the
inner side of the spoon. This time you
may find that your image is erect and
larger in size. If you increase the distance
of the spoon from your face, you may
see your image inverted (Fig. 15.11). You
can also compare the image of your pen
or pencil instead of your face.

Activity 15.5
Take a stainless steel spoon. Bring the
outer side of the spoon near your face
and look into it. Do you see your image
in it (Fig. 15.10)? Is this image different
from what you see in a plane mirror? Is
this image erect? Is the size of the image
the same, smaller or larger?

Fig. 15.11 Image from the inner side of a spoon

The curved shining surface of a
spoon acts as a mirror. The most
common example of a curved mirror is
a spherical mirror.
If the reflecting surface of a spherical
mirror is concave, it is called a concave
mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex,
then it is a convex mirror (Fig. 15.12).

Why are concave and convex mirrors
called spherical mirrors?
Take a rubber ball and cut a
portion of it with a knife or a hacksaw blade [Fig. 15.13 (a)]. (Be careful.
Ask an elder person to help you in
cutting the ball). The inner surface
of the cut ball is called concave and
the outer surface is called convex
(Fig. 15.13 (b)).

The inner surface of a spoon acts like
a concave mirror, while its outer surface
acts like a convex mirror.
We know that the image of an object
formed by a plane mirror cannot be
obtained on a screen. Let us investigate
if it is also true for the image formed by
a concave mirror.

Activity 15.6
CAUTION
You will conduct Activity 15.6 in the
sunlight. Be careful, never look
directly towards the sun or its image
as it may damage your eyes. You may
look at the image of the sun when it
is thrown on a screen or a wall.
180

Take a concave mirror. Hold it facing
the sun. Try to get the light reflected by
the mirror on a sheet of paper. Adjust
the distance of the paper until you get a
sharp bright spot on it (Fig. 15.14). Hold
the mirror and the sheet of paper steady
for a few minutes. Does the paper start
burning?
This bright spot is, in fact, the image
of the sun. Notice that this image is
formed on a screen. An image formed
on a screen is called a real image.
Recollect that in Activity 15.2 the image
formed by a plane mirror could not be
obtained on a screen. Such an image is
called a virtual image.
Now let us try to obtain on the screen
the image of a candle flame formed by a
concave mirror.

Activity 15.7
Fix a concave mirror on a stand (any
arrangement to keep the mirror steady
would do) and place it on a table
(Fig. 15.15). Paste a piece of white paper
on a cardboard sheet (say about

Keep a lighted candle on the table at a
distance of about 50 cm from the mirror.
Try to obtain the image of the flame on
the screen. For this, move the screen till
a sharp image of the flame is obtained.
Make sure that, the screen does not

obstruct the light from the candle falling
on the mirror. Is this image real or
virtual? Is it of the same size as the flame?
Now move the candle towards the
mirror and place it at different distances
from it. In each case try to obtain the
image on the screen. Record your
observation in Table 15.1. Is it possible
to obtain the image on the screen when
the candle is too close to the mirror
(Fig. 15.16)?
We see that the image formed by a
concave mirror can be smaller or larger
in size than the object. The image may
also be real or virtual.
Concave mirrors are used for many
purposes. You might have seen doctors
using concave mirrors for examining
eyes, ears, nose and throat. Concave
mirrors are also used by dentists
to see an enlarged image of the teeth
(Fig. 15.17). The reflectors of torches,
headlights of cars and scooters are
concave in shape (Fig. 15.18).

are convex mirrors. Convex mirrors can
form images of objects spread over a large
area. So, these help the drivers to see
the traffic behind them (Fig. 15.20).

telescopes and microscopes. Try to add
a few more uses of lenses to this list.

Activity 15.9
Take a convex lens or magnifying glass.
Put it in the path of sunrays. Place a
sheet of paper as shown (Fig. 15.23).
Adjust the distance between the lens and
the paper till you get a bright spot on
the paper. Hold the lens and the paper
in this position for a few minutes. Does
the paper begin to burn?
Now replace the convex lens with a
concave lens. Do you see a bright spot

A convex lens converges (bends
inward) the light generally falling on it
[Fig. 15.24 (a)]. Therefore, it is called a
converging lens. On the other hand, a
concave lens diverges (bends outward)
the light and is called a diverging lens

you not getting a bright spot this time?
We have seen in the case of mirrors
that for different positions of the object
the nature and size of the image change.
Is it true for lenses also?
Let us find out.

Activity 15.10
Take a convex lens and fix it on a stand
as you did with the concave mirror. Place
it on a table. Place a lighted candle at a
distance of about 50 cm from the lens
[Fig. 15.25 (a)]. Try to obtain the image
184

of the candle on a paper screen placed
on the other side of the lens. You may
have to move the screen towards or away
from the lens to get a sharp image of
the flame. What kind of image did you
get? Is it real or virtual?
Now vary the distance of the candle
from the lens [Fig. 15.25 (b)]. Try to
obtain the image of the candle flame
every time on the paper screen by
moving it. Record your observations as
you did in Activity 15.7 for the concave
mirror.

It means that we can see the
image formed by a lens from the
side opposite to that of the object.

are seven colours in a rainbow, though
it may not be easy to distinguish all of
them. These are ó red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo and violet.

You might have seen that when you
blow soap bubbles, they appear
colourful. Similarly, when light is
reflected from the sur face of a
Compact Disk (CD), you see many

mixture of different colours? Let us
investigate.

the white light consists of seven colours.
Try to identify these colours and write
their names in your notebook.
Can we mix these colours to get white
light? Let us try.

Take a circular cardboard disc of about
10 cm diameter. Divide this disc into

seven segments. Paint the seven
rainbow colours on these segments
as shown in Fig. 15.31 (a). You can
also paste, coloured papers on
these segments. Make a small hole
at the centre of the disc. Fix the
disc loosely on the tip of a refill of a
ball pen. Ensure that the disc rotates
freely [Fig. 15.31 (a)]. Rotate the disc
in the daylight. When the disc is
rotated fast, the colours get mixed
together and the disc appears
to be whitish [Fig. 15.31 (b)]. Such
a disc is popularly known as Newtonís

What you have learnt
Light travels along straight lines.
Any polished or a shining surface acts as a mirror.
An image which can be obtained on a screen is called a real image.
An image which cannot be obtained on a screen is called a virtual image.
The image formed by a plane mirror is erect. It is virtual and is of the
same size as the object. The image is at the same distance behind the
mirror as the object is in front of it.
In an image formed by a mirror, the left side of the object is seen on the
right side in the image, and right side of the object appears to be on the
left side in the image.
A concave mirror can form a real and inverted image. When the object is
placed very close to the mirror, the image formed is virtual, erect and
magnified.
Image formed by a convex mirror is erect, virtual and smaller in size
than the object.
A convex lens can form real and inverted image. When the object is
placed very close to the lens, the image formed is virtual, erect and
magnified. When used to see objects magnified, the convex lens is called
a magnifying glass.
A concave lens always forms erect, virtual and smaller image than the
object.
White light is composed of seven colours.

Did you know?
The mirrors can be used as weapons. Archimedes, a Greek scientist, is said
to have done just that more than two thousand years ago. When the
Romans attacked Syracuse, a coastal city-state in Greece, Archimedes used
mirrors arranged as shown in Fig. 15.34. The mirrors could be moved in any
direction. They were positioned such that they reflected the sunlight on the
Roman soldiers. The soldiers were dazzled by the sunlight. They did not
know what was happening. They got confused and ran away. This was an
example of triumph of ideas over military might.
