FRICTION

Y

ou might have seen a driver of a
car or a truck slowing down the
vehicle at a traffic signal. You, too,
slow down your bicycle whenever
needed by applying brakes. Have you
ever thought why a vehicle slows
down when brakes are applied? Not
only vehicles, any object, moving over
the surface of another object slows
down when no external force is
applied on it. Finally it stops. Have
you not seen a moving ball on the
ground stopping after some time?
Why do we slip when we step on a
banana peel (Fig. 12.1)? Why is it
difficult to walk on a smooth and wet
floor?

12.1 Force of Friction

Activity 12.1

Gently push a book on a table [Fig.
12.2(a)]. You observe that it stops
after moving for some distance.
Repeat this activity pushing the
book from the opposite direction
[Fig. 12.2, (b)]. Does the book stop
this time, too? Can you think of an
explanation? Can we say that a force
must be acting on the book
opposing its motion? This force is
called the force of friction.

You saw that if you apply the force
along the left, friction acts along the
right. If you apply the force along the
right, the friction acts along the left
direction. In both cases the force opposes
the motion of the book. The force of
friction always opposes the applied force.
In the above activity, the force of
friction acts between the surface of the
book and the surface of the table.
Is the friction the same for all the
sur faces? Does it depend on the
smoothness of the surfaces? Let us find
out.

for this difference? Repeat this
activity by wrapping a piece of jute
bag around the brick. What do you
observe?
Spring Balance
Spring balance is a device used for
measuring the force acting on an
object. It consists of a coiled spring
which gets stretched when a force is
applied to it. Stretching of the spring
is measured by a pointer moving on
a graduated scale. The reading on the
scale gives the magnitude of the force.

12.2 Factors affecting
Friction
Activity 12.2

Tie a string around a brick. Pull the
brick by a spring balance (Fig.
12.3). You need to apply some force.
Note down the reading on the
spring balance when the brick just
begins to move. It gives you a
measure of the of force of friction
between the surface of the brick and
the floor.

Make an inclined plane on a smooth
floor, or on a table. You may use a
wooden board supported by bricks,
or books. [Fig. 12.4 (a)]. Put a mark
with a pen at any point A on the
inclined plane. Now let a pencil cell
move down from this point. How far
does it move on the table before
coming to rest? Note down the
distance. Now spread a piece of cloth

over the table. Make sure that there
are no wrinkles in the cloth. Try the
activity again [Fig. 12.4 (b)].

Does the distance covered depend on
the nature of the surface on which the
cell moves?
Could the smoothness of the surface
of the cell also affect the distance
travelled by it?

sandpaper around
the cell.

Friction is caused by the
irregularities on the two surfaces in
contact. Even those surfaces which
appear very smooth have a large number
of minute irregularities on them (Fig.
12.5). Irregularities on the two surfaces
lock into one another. When we attempt
to move any surface, we have to apply a
force to overcome interlocking. On
rough surfaces, there are a larger
number of irregularities. So the force of
friction is greater if a rough surface is
involved.

a thin layer of sand over the table.

the
same
slope
throughout the activity.

In which case is the distance covered
the minimum? Why is the distance
covered by the pencil cell different every
time. Try to reason why? Discuss the
result.
FRICTION

Fig. 12.5 : Surface irregularities

We see that the friction is caused by
the interlocking of irregularities in the
two surfaces. It is obvious that the force
of friction will increase if the two
surfaces are pressed harder. You can
experience it by dragging a mat when
nobody is sitting on it, and when a
preson is sitting on it.
Recall your experience when last time
you moved a heavy box from one place
to another. If you have no such
experience, get that experience now.
What is easier — to move the box from
rest, or to move it when it is already in
motion?
The force required to overcome
friction at the instant an object starts
moving from rest is a measure of static
friction. On the other hand, the force
required to keep the object moving with
the same speed is a measure of sliding
friction.

friction and you find it somewhat easier
to move the box already in motion than
to get it started.

12.3 Friction : A Necessary
Evil
Recall now some of your experiences. Is
it easier to hold a kulhar (earthen pot)
or a glass tumbler? Suppose the outer
surface of the tumbler is greasy, or has
a film of cooking oil on it; would it
become easier or more difficult to hold
it? Just think : would it be possible to
hold the glass at all if there is no
friction?
Recall also how difficult it is to move
on a wet muddy track, or wet marble
floor. Can you imagine being able to walk
at all if there were no friction?

When the box starts sliding, the
contact points on its surface, do not get
enough time to lock into the contact
points on the floor. So, the sliding
friction is slightly smaller than the static

You could not write with pen or
pencil if there were no friction. When
your teacher is writing with chalk on
the blackboard, its rough surface rubs
off some chalk particles which stick to

the black board. Could it happen if there
were no friction between the chalk and
the board?
If an object started moving, it would
never stop if there were no friction. Had
there been no friction between the tyres
of the automobiles and the road, they
could not be started or stoped or turned
to change the direction of motion. You
could not fix a nail in the wall (Fig. 12.7)
or tie a knot. Without friction no building
could be constructed.

On the other hand, friction is an evil,
too. It wears out the materials whether
they are screws, ball bearings or soles
of shoes (Fig. 12.8). You must have seen
worn-out steps of foot over-bridges at
railway stations.
Friction can also produce heat.
Vigorously rub your palms together for
a few minutes (Fig. 12.9). How do you
feel? When you strike a matchstick
against the rough surface, it catches fire
(Fig. 12.10).

is operated, heat generated causes much
wastage of energy. We shall discuss the
ways of minimising friction in the
following section.
151

12.4 Increasing and Reducing
Friction
As you have seen in the previous section,
friction is desirable in some situations.
Have you ever thought why the sole
of your shoes is grooved [Fig. 12.11 (a)]?
It is done to provide the shoes better
grip on the floor, so that you can move
safely. Similarly, the treaded tyres of
cars,trucks and bulldozers provide better
grip with the ground.

In some situations, however, friction
is undesirable and we would want to
minimize it.
Why do you sprinkle fine powder on
the carrom board? You might have
noticed that when a few drops of oil are
poured on the hinges of a door, the door
moves smoothly. A bicycle and a motor
mechanic uses grease between the
moving parts of these machines. In all
the above cases, we want to reduce

(b)

Fig. 12.11 : Soles of shoes and tyres are treaded
to increase friction

We deliberately increase friction by
using brake pads in the brake system
of bicycles and automobiles. When you
are riding a bicycle, the brake pads do
not touch the wheels. But when you
press the brake lever, these pads arrest
the motion of the rim due to friction.
The wheel stops moving. You might have
seen that kabaddi players rub their
hands with soil for a better grip of their
opponents. Gymnasts apply some coarse
substance on their hands to increase
friction for better grip.

friction in order to increase efficiency.
When oil, grease or graphite is applied
between the moving part of a machine,
a thin layer is formed there and moving
surfaces do not directly rub against each
other (Fig. 12.13). Interlocking of
irregularities is avoided to a great extent.
Movement becomes smooth. The
substances which reduce friction are
called lubricants. In some machines, it
may not be advisable to use oil as
lubricant. An air cushion between the
moving parts is used to reduce friction.
Lubricant

SCIENCE

Activity 12.4
Can we reduce friction to
zero by polishing surfaces
or using large amount of
lubricants?

Friction can never be
entirely eleminated. No
surface is perfectly smooth.
Some irregularities are
always there.

Take a few pencils which are
cylindrical in shape. Place them
parallel to each other on a table.
Place a thick book over it (Fig.
12.15). Now push the book. You
observe the pencils rolling as the
book moves. Do you feel it easier to
move the book in this way than to
slide it? Do you think that
resistance to the motion of the book
has been reduced? Have you seen
heavy machinary being moved by
placing logs under it?

12.5 Wheels Reduce Friction

You must have seen attaches and other
pieces of luggage fitted with rollers. Even
a child can pull such pieces of luggage
(Fig. 12.14). Why is it so? Let us find
out.

Fig. 12.14 : Rolling reduces friction
FRICTION

When one body rolls over the surface
of another body, the resistance to its
motion is called the rolling friction.
Rolling reduces friction. It is always
easier to roll than to slide a body over
another. That is the reason it is
convenient to pull the luggages fitted
with rollers. Can you now understand
why wheel is said to be one of the
greatest inventions of mankind?
Since the rolling friction is smaller
than the sliding friction, sliding is
replaced in most machines by rolling
by the use of ball bearings. Common
examples are the use of ball bearings
between hubs and the axles of ceiling
fans and bicycles (Fig. 12.16).

is fluids. So we can say that fluids exert
force of friction on objects in motion
through them.
The frictional force exerted by fluids
is also called drag.

The frictional force on an object in a
fluid depends on its speed with respect
to the fluid. The frictional force also
depends on the shape of the object and
the nature of the fluid.
It is obvious that when objects move
through fluids, they have to overcome
friction acting on them. In this process
they lose energy. Efforts are, therefore,
made to minimize friction. So, objects
are given special shapes. Where do you
think the scientists get hints for these
special shapes? From nature, of course.
Birds and fishes have to move about in
fluids all the time. Their bodies must
have evolved to shapes which would
make them not to lose much energy in
overcoming friction. You read about
these shapes in Class VI. Look carefully
at the shape of an aeroplanes (Fig.
12.17). Do you find any similarity in its
shape and that of a bird? In fact, all
vehicles are designed to have shapes
which reduce fluid friction.
