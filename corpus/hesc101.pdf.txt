CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT

P

aheli and Boojho went to their
uncle’s house during the summer
vacation. Their uncle is a farmer.
One day they saw some tools like khurpi,
sickle, shovel, plough, etc., in the field.

Food has to be

I want to know
where and how we
use these tools.

You have lear nt that all living
organisms require food. Plants can make
their food themselves. Can you recall
how green plants synthesise their own
food? Animals including humans can
not make their own food. So, where do
animals get their food from?
But, first of all why do we have to eat
food?
You already know that the energy
from food is utilised by organisms for
carrying out their various body
functions, such as digestion, respiration
and excretion. We get our food from
plants, or animals, or both.

o
n

Since we all need food,
how can we provide
food to a large number
of people in our
country?

d
e

In order to provide food for a large
population— regular production, proper
management and distribution of food is
necessary.

1.1 Agricultural Practices
Till 10,000 B.C. people were nomadic.
They were wandering in groups from
place to place in search of food and
shelter. They ate raw fruits and
vegetables and started hunting for
animals for food. Later, they could
cultivate land and produce rice, wheat
and other food crops. Thus, was born
‘Agriculture’.

When plants of the same kind are grown
and cultivated at one place on a large
scale, it is called a crop. For example,
crop of wheat means that all the plants
grown in a field are that of wheat.
You already know that crops are of
different types like cereals, vegetables
and fruits. These can be classified on the
basis of the season in which they grow.
India is a vast country. The climatic
conditions like temperature, humidity
and rainfall vary from one region to
another. Accordingly, there is a rich

variety of crops grown in different parts
of the country. Despite this diversity,
two broad cropping patterns can be
identified. These are:
(i) Kharif Crops : The crops which are
sown in the rainy season are called
kharif crops. The rainy season in India
is generally from June to September.
Paddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut,
cotton, etc., are kharif crops.
(ii) Rabi Crops : The crops grown in the
winter season are called rabi crops.
Their time period is generally from
October to March. Examples of rabi
crops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard
and linseed.
Besides these, pulses and vegetables
are grown during summer at many
places.

1.2 Basic Practices of Crop
Production

Why can paddy not be
grown in the winter season?

Paddy requires a lot of
water. Therefore, it is grown
only in the rainy season.

o
n

Cultivation of crops involves several
activities undertaken by farmers over a
period of time. You may find that these
activities are similar to those carried out
by a gardener or even by you when you
grow ornamental plants in your house.
These activities or tasks are referred
2

d
e

The preparation of soil is the first step
before growing a crop. One of the most
important tasks in agriculture is to turn
the soil and loosen it. This allows the
roots to penetrate deep into the soil. The
loose soil allows the roots to breathe
easily even when they go deep into the
soil. Why does the loosening of soil allow
the roots to breathe easily?
The loosened soil helps in the growth
of earthworms and microbes present in
the soil. These organisms are friends of
the farmer since they further turn and
loosen the soil and add humus to it.
But why does the soil need to be turned
and loosened?
You have learnt in the previous
classes that soil contains minerals,
water, air and some living organisms.
In addition, dead plants and animals
get decomposed by soil organisms. In
this way, various nutrients held in the
dead organisms are released back into
the soil. These nutrients are again
absorbed by plants.
Since only a few centimetres of the
top layer of soil supports plant growth,
turning and loosening of soil brings the
nutrient-rich soil to the top so that
plants can use these nutrients. Thus,
SCIENCE

turning and loosening of soil is very
important for cultivation of crops.
The process of loosening and turning
of the soil is called tilling or ploughing.
This is done by using a plough. Ploughs
are made of wood or iron. If the soil is
very dry, it may need watering before
ploughing. The ploughed field may have
big pieces of soil called crumbs. It is
necessary to break these crumbs with a
plank. The field is levelled for sowing as
well as for irrigation purposes. The
levelling of soil is done with the help of
a leveller.
Sometimes, manure is added to the
soil before tilling. This helps in proper
mixing of manure with soil. The soil is
watered before sowing.

Plough : This is being used since
ancient times for tilling the soil, adding
fertilisers to the crop, removing the
weeds, scraping of soil, etc. This
implement is made of wood and is drawn
by a pair of bulls or other animals
(horses, camels, etc.). It contains a
strong triangular iron strip called
ploughshare. The main part of the
plough is a long log of wood which is
called a ploughshaft. There is a handle
at one end of the shaft. The other end is
attached to a beam which is placed on
the bulls’ necks. One pair of bulls and a
man can easily operate the plough
[Fig. 1.1 (a)].
The indigenous wooden plough is
increasingly being replaced by iron
ploughs nowadays.
Hoe : It is a simple tool which is used
for removing weeds and for loosening
the soil. It has a long rod of wood or
iron. A strong, broad and bent plate of
iron is fixed to one of its ends and

Agricultural Implements
Before sowing the seeds, it is necessary to
break soil to the size of grains to get better
yield. This is done with the help of
various tools. The main tools used for this
purpose are the plough, hoe and cultivator.

Cultivator : Nowadays ploughing is
done by tractor driven cultivator. The
use of cultivator saves labour and time.
[Fig. 1.1 (c)].

Activity 1.1
Take a beaker and fill half of it
with water. Put a handful of wheat
seeds and stir well. Wait for some
time.
Are there seeds which float on
water? Would those be lighter or
heavier than those which sink? Why
would they be lighter? Damaged seeds
become hollow and are thus lighter.
Therefore, they float on water.
This is a good method for
separating good, healthy seeds from
the damaged ones.
Before sowing, one of the important
tasks is to know about the tools used
for sowing seeds [Fig. 1.2 (a), (b)].

1.4 Sowing

Sowing is the most important part of
crop production. Before sowing, good
quality seeds are selected. Good quality
seeds are clean and healthy seeds of a
good variety. Farmers prefer to use seeds
which give a high yield.

d
e

Traditional tool : The tool used
traditionally for sowing seeds is
shaped like a funnel [Fig. 1.2 (a)]. The
seeds are filled into the funnel,
passed down through two or three
pipes having sharp ends. These
ends pierce into the soil and place
seeds there.

Selection of Seeds

o
n

One day I saw my mother put
some gram seeds in a vessel
and pour some water on
them. After a few minutes
some seeds started to float
on top. I wonder why some
seeds float on water!

sufficient sunlight, nutrients and water
from the soil. Sometimes a few plants
have to be removed to prevent
overcrowding.

1.5 Adding Manure and
Fertilisers
The substances which are added to the
soil in the form of nutrients for the
healthy growth of plants are called
manure and fertilisers.
Fig. 1.2 (b) : A seed drill

Seed drill : Nowadays the seed drill [Fig.
1.2 (b)] is used for sowing with the help
of tractors. This tool sows the seeds
uniformly at proper distances and
depths. It ensures that seeds get covered
by the soil after sowing. This prevents
damage caused by birds. Sowing by
using a seed drill saves time and labour.

There is a nursery near my
school. I found that little
plants were kept in small
bags. Why are they
kept like this?

Seeds of a few plants
such as paddy are first
grown in a nursery. When
they grow into plantlets,
they are transplanted in
the field manually. Some
forest plants and flowering
plants are also grown in
the nursery.

An appropriate distance between the
seeds is important to avoid overcrowding
of plants. This allows plants to get

I saw a healthy crop growing
in a farm. In the neighbouring
farm, the plants were weak.
Why do some plants grow
better than others?

Soil supplies mineral nutrients to the
crop. These nutrients are essential for
the growth of plants. In certain areas,
farmers grow crop after crop in the same
field. The field is never left uncultivated
or fallow. Imagine what happens to the
nutrients?
Continuous growing of crops makes
the soil poorer in certain nutrients.
Therefore, farmers have to add manure
to the fields to replenish the soil with
nutrients. This process is called
manuring. Improper or insufficient
manuring results in weak plants.
Manure is an organic substance
obtained from the decomposition of
plant or animal wastes. Farmers dump
plant and animal waste in pits at open
places and allow it to decompose. The
decomposition is caused by some
microorganisms. The decomposed
matter is used as organic manure.
You have alr eady lear nt about
vermicomposting in Class VI.

Activity 1.2
Take moong or gram seeds and
germinate them. Select three equal
sized seedlings out of these. Now
take three empty glasses or similar
vessels. Mark them A, B and C. To
glass A add little amount of soil
mixed with a little cow dung manure.
In glass B put the same amount of
soil mixed with a little urea. Take
the same amount of soil in glass C
without adding anything [Fig.
1.3(a)]. Now pour the same amount
of water in each glass and plant the
seedlings in them. Keep them in a
safe place and water them daily. After
7 to 10 days observe their growth
[Fig. 1.3(b)].

showed better growth of plants? In
which glass was the growth fastest?
Fertilisers are chemical substances
which are rich in a particular
nutrient. How are these different from
manure? Fertilisers are produced in
factories. Some examples of fertilisers
are— urea, ammonium sulphate,
super phosphate, potash, NPK
(Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium).
The use of fertilisers has helped
farmers to get better yield of crops
such as wheat, paddy and maize. But
excessive use of fertilisers has made
the soil less fertile. Fertilisers have also
become a source of water pollution.
Therefore, in order to maintain the
fertility of the soil, we have to
substitute fertilisers by organic
manure or leave the field uncultivated
(fallow) in between two crops.
The use of manure improves soil
texture as well as its water retaining
capacity. It replenishes the soil with
all the nutrients.
Another method of replenishing
the soil with nutrients is through crop
rotation. This can be done by growing
different crops alternately. Earlier,
farmers in northern India used to
grow legumes as fodder in one season
and wheat in the next season. This
helped in the replenishment of the soil
with nitrogen. Farmers are being
encouraged to adopt this practice.
In the previous classes, you have
learnt about Rhizobium bacteria.
These are present in the nodules of
the roots of leguminous plants. They
fix atmospheric nitrogen.

A fertiliser is an inorganic
salt.

Manure is a natural substance obtained
by the decomposition of cattle dung,
human waste and plant residues.

1.6 Irrigation

o
n

All living beings need water to live.
Water is important for proper growth
and development of flowers, fruits and
seeds of plants. Water is absorbed by
the plant roots. Along with water,
minerals and fertilisers are also
absorbed. Plants contain nearly 90%
water. Water is essential because
germination of seeds does not take place
under dry conditions. Nutrients
dissolved in water get transported to

each part of the plant. Water also
protects the crop from both frost and
hot air currents. To maintain the
moisture of the soil for healthy crop
growth, fields have to be watered
regularly.
The supply of water to crops at
different intervals is called irrigation.
The time and frequency of irrigation
varies from crop to crop, soil to soil and
season to season. In summer, the
frequency of watering is higher. Why is
it so? Could it be due to the increased
rate of evaporation of water from the soil
and the leaves?
I am very careful this
year about watering
the plants. Last
summer my plants
dried up and died.

Sources of irrigation : The sources of
irrigation are— wells, tubewells, ponds,
lakes, rivers, dams and canals.
7

Traditional Methods of
Irrigation
The water available in wells,
lakes and canals is lifted up
by different methods in
different regions, for taking it
to the fields.
Cattle or human labour is
used in these methods. So
these methods are cheaper,
but less efficient. The various
traditional ways are:

Modern Methods of
Irrigation
Modern methods of irrigation
help us to use water
economically. The main
methods used are as follows:
(i) Sprinkler System: This
system is more useful on the
uneven land where sufficient
water is not available. The
perpendicular pipes, having
rotating nozzles on top, are
joined to the main pipeline
at regular intervals. When
water is allowed to flow
through the main pipe under
pressure with the help of a pump, it
escapes from the rotating nozzles. It gets
sprinkled on the crop as if it is raining.
Sprinkler is very useful for sandy soil
[Fig. 1.5 (a)].

position of the roots. So it is called drip
system. It is the best technique for
watering fruit plants, gardens and trees.
The system provides water to plants drop
by drop [Fig. 1.5(b)]. Water is not wasted
at all. It is a boon in regions where
availability of water is poor.

1.7 Protection from Weeds
Boojho and Paheli went to a nearby
wheat field and saw that there were some
other plants in the field.
Have these other
plants been planted
purposely?

In a field many other undesirable
plants may grow naturally along with
the crop. These undesirable plants are
called weeds.
The removal of weeds is called
weeding. Weeding is necessary since
weeds compete with the crop plants for
water, nutrients, space and light. Thus,
they affect the growth of the crop. Some
weeds interfere even in harvesting and
may be poisonous for animals and
human beings.
Farmers adopt many ways to remove
weeds and control their growth. Tilling
before sowing of crops helps in
uprooting and killing of weeds, which
may then dry up and get mixed with
the soil. The best time for the removal
of weeds is before they produce flowers
and seeds. The manual removal includes
physical removal of weeds by uprooting
or cutting them close to the ground,
from time to time. This is done with the
help of a khurpi. A seed drill [Fig. 1.2(b)]
is also used to uproot weeds.
Weeds are also controlled by using
certain chemicals, called weedicides,
like 2,4-D. These are sprayed in the
fields to kill the weeds. They do not
damage the crops. The weedicides are
diluted with water to the extent required
and sprayed in the fields with a sprayer.
(Fig. 1.6).

Do weedicides have any
effect on the person handling
the weedicide sprayer?

As already mentioned, the weedicides
are sprayed during the vegetative growth
of weeds before flowering and seed
formation. Spraying of weedicides may
affect the health of farmers. So they
should use these chemicals very carefully.
They should cover their nose and mouth
with a piece of cloth during spraying of
these chemicals.

1.8 Harvesting

Harvesting of a crop is an important
task. The cutting of crop after it is
mature is called harvesting. In
harvesting, crops are pulled out or cut
close to the ground. It usually takes 3
to 4 months for a cereal crop to mature.
Harvesting in our
country is either done
manually
by
sickle
(Fig. 1.7) or by a machine
called harvester. In the
harvested crop, the grain Fig. 1.7 :
seeds need to be separated

SCIENCE

from the chaff. This process is called
threshing. This is carried out with the
help of a machine called ‘combine’ which
is in fact a combined harvester and
thresher (Fig. 1.8).

Harvest Festivals
After three or four months of hard
work there comes the day of the
harvest. The sight of golden fields
of standing crop, laden with grain,
fills the hearts of farmers with joy
a n d a s e n s e o f w e l l -b e i n g . T h e
efforts of the past season have
borne fruit and it is time to relax
and enjoy a little. The period of
harvest is, thus, of great joy and
happiness in all parts of India.
Men and women celebrate it with
great
enthusiasm.
Special
festivals associated with the
h a r v e s t s e a s o n are P o n g a l ,
Baisakhi, Holi, Diwali, Nabanya
and Bihu.

1.9 Storage

After harvesting, sometimes
stubs are left in the field, which
are burnt by farmers. Paheli is
worried. She knows that it
causes pollution. It may also
catch fire and damage the crops
lying in the fields.

Farmers with small holdings of land
do the separation of grain and chaff by
winnowing (Fig. 1.9). You have already
studied this in Class VI.

CROP PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT

Storage of produce is an important task.
If the crop grains are to be kept for
longer time, they should be safe from
moisture,
insects,
rats
and
microorganisms. The fresh crop has
more moisture. If freshly harvested
grains (seeds) are stored without drying,
they may get spoilt or attacked by
organisms, losing their germination
capacity. Hence, before storing them,
the grains are properly dried in the sun
to reduce the moisture in them. This
prevents the attack by insect pests,
bacteria and fungi. Farmers store

After completing this Table, you
must have seen that, like plants,
animals also provide us with different
kinds of food. Many people living in the
coastal areas consume fish as a major
part of their diet. In the previous classes
you have learnt about the food that we
obtain from plants. We have just seen
that the process of crop production
involves a number of steps like selection
of seeds, sowing, etc. Similarly, animals
reared at home or in farms, have to be
provided with proper food, shelter and
care. When this is done on a large scale,
it is called animal husbandry.
Fish is good for health.
We get cod liver oil from fish
which is rich in vitamin D.

Himanshu : Sir namaskar, I am Himanshu. Here are my friends Mohan, David
and Sabiha. We want some information about crops. Please guide
us.
Shri Patel :

Namaskar and welcome all of you. What are your queries?

Sabiha : When did you start this work and what are the main crops that
you grow?
Shri Patel :

About 75 years ago, my grandfather started this work. The main
crops that we grow are wheat, gram, soyabean and moong.

David : Sir, can you tell us the difference between traditional and modern
agricultural practices?
Shri Patel :

Earlier we used traditional tools like sickle, bullock plough, trowel,
etc., and depended on rain water for irrigation. But now we use
modern methods of irrigation. We use implements like tractors,
cultivators, seed drill and harvester. We get good quality seeds.
We carry out soil testing and use manure and fertilisers. New
information about agriculture is obtained through radio, T.V. and
other sources. As a result we are able to get good crops on a large
scale. This year we got 9 to 11 quintals of gram crop/acre and 20
to 25 quintals of wheat/acre. In my opinion awareness of new
technology is important for better crop yield.

Mohan :

Sabiha, come here and see some earthworms. Are they helpful to
the farmers?

Sabiha :

Oh Mohan! we learnt about it in Class VI.

Shri Patel :

Earthworms turn the soil and loosen it for proper aeration, so
they help the farmer.

David : Can we have some seeds of the crops you grow here?
[They put some seeds, fertilisers and soil sample in the bags.]

Himanshu :
