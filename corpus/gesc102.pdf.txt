digestion.

2.1 DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING FOOD

The mode of taking food into the body
varies in different organisms. Bees and
humming-birds suck the nectar of
plants, infants of human and many
other animals feed on motherís milk.
Snakes like the python swallow the
animals they prey upon. Some aquatic
animals filter tiny food particles floating
nearby and feed upon them.

ou have learnt in Chapter 1 that
plants can prepare their own food
by the process of photosynthesis
but animals cannot. Animals get their
food from plants, either directly by
eating plants or indirectly by eating
animals that eat plants. Some animals
eat both plants and animals. Recall that
all organisms including humans require
food for growth, repair and functioning
of the body. Animal nutrition includes
nutrient requirement, mode of intake
of food and its utilisation in the body.

We take in food through the mouth,
digest and utilise it. The unused parts
of the food are defecated. Have you ever
wondered what happens to the food
inside the body? The food passes
through a continuous canal (Fig. 2.2)
which begins at the buccal cavity and
ends at the anus. The canal can be
divided into various compartments:
(1) the buccal cavity, (2) foodpipe or
oesophagus, (3) stomach, (4) small
intestine, (5) large intestine ending in
the rectum and (6) the anus. Is it not a
very long path? These parts together
form the alimentary canal (digestive
tract). The food components gradually
get digested as food travels through the
various compartments. The inner walls

Sweets and tooth decay

no
t

Normally bacteria are present in our mouth but they are not harmful
to us. However, if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating,
many harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it. These bacteria
break down the sugars present from the leftover food and release
acids (see Chapter 5 to know what an acid is). The acids gradually
damage the teeth (Fig. 2.5). This is called tooth decay. If it is not
treated in time, it causes severe toothache and in extreme cases
results in tooth loss. Chocolates, sweets, soft drinks and other sugar
products are the major culprits of tooth decay.
Therefore, one should clean the teeth with a brush or datun and
dental floss (a special strong thread which is moved between two
teeth to take out trapped food particles) at least twice a day and
rinse the mouth after every meal. Also, one should not put dirty
fingers or any unwashed object in the mouth.

Sometimes when you eat in a hurry, talk or laugh while eating, you may cough,
get hiccups or a choking sensation. This happens when food particles enter the
windpipe. The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs. It runs adjacent
to the foodpipe. But inside the throat, air and food share a common passage.
Then how is food prevented from entering the windpipe? During the act of
swallowing a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the
food into the foodpipe. If, by chance, food particles enter the windpipe, we feel
choked, get hiccups or cough.

The small intestine
The small intestine is highly coiled and
is about 7.5 metres long. It receives
secretions from the liver and the pancreas.
Besides, its wall also secretes juices.
The liver is a reddish brown gland
situated in the upper part of the
abdomen on the right side. It is the
largest gland in the body. It secretes bile
juice that is stored in a sac called the
gall bladder (Fig. 2.2). The bile plays
an important role in the digestion of fats.
The pancreas is a large cream
coloured gland located just below the
stomach (Fig. 2.2). The pancreatic juice
acts on carbohydrates, fats and proteins
and changes them into simpler forms.

and the chest. Food is pushed down by
movement of the wall of the foodpipe.
Actually this movement takes place
throughout the alimentary canal and
pushes the food downwards (Fig. 2.7).
At times the food is not accepted by our
stomach and is vomited out. Recall the
instances when you vomited after eating
and think of the reason for it. Discuss
with your parents and teacher.
The stomach is a thick-walled bag. Its
shape is like a flattened U and it is the
widest part of the alimentary canal. It
receives food from the food pipe at one
end and opens into the small intestine
at the other.
The inner lining of the stomach
secretes mucous, hydrochloric acid and
digestive juices. The mucous protects
the lining of the stomach. The acid kills
many bacteria that enter along with the

The working of the stomach was discovered by a
strange accident. In 1822, a man named Alexis St.
Martin was badly hit by a shot gun. The bullet had
seriously damaged the chest wall and made a hole
in his stomach. He was brought to an American
army doctor William Beaumont. The doctor saved
the patient but he could not close the hole properly
and left it bandaged (Fig. 2.8). Beaumont took it as
a great opportunity to see the inside of the stomach
through the hole. He made some wonderful
observations.
Beaumont found that the stomach was churning Fig. 2.8 Alexis St. Martin’s

food. Its wall secreted a fluid which could digest
the food. He also observed that the end of the stomach opens into the intestine
only after the digestion of the food inside the stomach is completed.

proteins required by the body. This is
called assimilation. In the cells, glucose
breaks down with the help of oxygen
into carbon dioxide and water, and
energy is released. The food that
remains undigested and unabsorbed
enters into the large intestine.

Absorption in the small
intestine

The large intestine is wider and shorter
than small intestine. It is about 1.5 metre
in length. Its function is to absorb water
and some salts from the undigested food
material. The remaining waste passes
into the rectum and remains there as
semi-solid faeces. The faecal matter is
removed through the anus from
time-to-time. This is called egestion.

The digested food can now pass into the
blood vessels in the wall of the intestine.
This process is called absorption. The
inner walls of the small intestine have
thousands of finger-like outgrowths.
These are called villi (singular villus).
Can you guess what the role of villi could
be in the intestine? The villi increase
the surface area for absorption of the
digested food. Each villus has a network
of thin and small blood vessels close to
its surface. The surface of the villi
absorbs the digested food materials. The
absorbed substances are transported
via the blood vessels to different organs
of the body where they are used to build
complex substances such as the

Large intestine

ed

The partly digested food now reaches the
lower part of the small intestine where
the intestinal juice completes the
digestion of all components of the food.
The carbohydrates get broken into
simple sugars such as glucose, fats into
fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins
into amino acids.

2.3 DIGESTION IN GRASS-EATING
ANIMALS

Have you observed cows, buffaloes
and other grass-eating animals
chewing continuously even when
they are not eating? Actually, they
quickly swallow the grass and store
it in a part of the stomach called
rumen (Fig. 2.9). Here the food gets

Sometime you may have experienced the need to pass watery stool frequently.
This condition is known as diarrhoea. It may be caused by an infection, food
poisoning or indigestion. It is very common in India, particularly among children.
Under severe conditions it can be fatal. This is because of the excessive loss of
water and salts from the body. Diarrhoea should not be neglected. Even before a
doctor is consulted the patient should be given plenty of boiled and cooled water
with a pinch of salt and sugar dissolved in it. This is called Oral Rehydration
Solution (ORS).

Paheli wants to know why
these animals cannot chew
food properly at the time they
take it in?

Ruminants have a large sac-like
structure called rumen between the
oesophagus and the small intestine
(Fig. 2.9). The cellulose of the food is
digested here by the action of certain
bacteria which are not present in humans.
So far you have learnt about animals
which possess the digestive system. But
there are many small organisms which
do not have a mouth and a digestive
system. Then, how do they acquire and
digest food? In the section below you will

But later the cud returns to the mouth

it. This process is called rumination and
these animals are called ruminants.

of carbohydrate. Many animals,
including humans, cannot digest

vacuoles (Fig. 2.10) in its cytoplasm.
Amoeba constantly changes its shape
and position. It pushes out one, or
more finger -like projections, called
pseudopodia or false feet for movement
and capture of food.

digestion of protein starts in the stomach. The bile secreted from the
liver, the pancreatic juice from the pancreas and the digestive juice from
the intestinal wall complete the digestion of all components of food in
the small intestine. The digested food is absorbed in the blood vessels
