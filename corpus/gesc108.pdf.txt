Winds, Storms and Cyclones

O

But, what are cyclones? How are
they formed? Why are they so
destructive? In this chapter we shall
seek answers to some of these questions.
We begin with some activities
involving air. These activities will clarify
some basic features concerning a
cyclone. Before we begin, remember that
the moving air is called the wind.

rissa was hit by a cyclone with
wind speed of 200 km/h on
18 October 1999. The cyclone
smashed 45,000 houses making
7,00,000 people homeless. On
29 October the same year, a second
cyclone with wind speed of 260 km/h
hit Orissa again. It was accompanied by
water waves about 9 m high. Thousands
of people lost their lives. Property worth
crores of rupees was destroyed. The
cyclone affected agriculture, transport,
communication, and electricity supply.

You need to boil water in the following
activity.
Take a tin can with a lid. Fill it
approximately half with water. Heat the
can on a candle flame till the water boils.
Let the water boil for a few minutes. Blow
out the candle. Immediately put the lid
tightly on the can. Be careful in handling
the hot can. Put the can carefully in a
shallow metallic vessel or a washbasin.
Pour fresh water over the can.

Fig. 8.2 Can with hot water being cooled

is blowing. You can list some more
experiences which show that the air has
pressure.
Let us now try to explain why the
can (or the bottle) gets distorted. As
water is poured over the can, some
steam in the can condenses into water,
reducing the amount of air inside. The
pressure of air inside the can decreases
than the pressure exerted by the air
from outside the can. As a result the
can gets compressed.
This activity again confirms that air
exerts pressure.

Can you guess why the shape of the
can gets distorted?
If you cannot get a tin can, take a
soft plastic bottle. Fill it with hot water.
Empty the bottle and immediately cap
it tightly. Place the bottle under running
water.
Recall now some of your experiences.
When you fly a kite, does the wind
coming from your back help?
If you are in a boat, is it easier to
row it if there is wind coming from
behind you?
Do you find it difficult to ride a bicycle
against the direction of the wind.
You know that we have to fill air into
the bicycle tube to keep it tight. Also,
you know that a bicycle tube overfilled
with air may burst. What is the air doing
inside the tube?
Discuss with your friends how the
air in the bicycle tube keeps it in shape.
All these experiences show that the
air exerts pressure. It is due to this
pressure that the leaves of trees,
banners, or flags flutter when the wind

on its side and place the paper ball just
inside its mouth. Now try to blow on
the ball to force it into the bottle. Try
the activity with bottles of different sizes.

Activity 8.4

Can you blow and lift?
Hold a strip of paper, 20 cm long and
3 cm wide, between your thumb and
forefinger as shown in the Fig. 8.5. Now
blow over the paper.
82

What do you think will happen to
the paper?
Let us try to understand the
observations in Activities 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4.
Were the observations along the lines
you thought? Do you get the feeling
that the increased wind speed is
accompanied by a reduced air pressure?
When we blow into the mouth of the
bottle, the air near the mouth has higher
speed. This decreases the pressure
there. The air pressure inside the bottle
is higher than near the mouth. The air
inside the bottle pushes the ball out.
In Activity 8.3 you saw that when you
blew between the balloons, they moved

the region where the air pressure is
high to the region where the pressure
is low. The greater the difference in
pressure, the faster the air moves. But
how are the pressure differences created
in nature? Is the difference in
temperature involved? The following
activities will help you to understand
this.

towards each other. How could this
happen? This could happen if the
pressure of air between the balloons
were somehow reduced. The pressure
outside the balloons would then push
them towards each other.
In Activity 8.4 you saw that when you
blew over the paper strip, it went
upwards. Again, this could happen if
blowing over the paper reduced the air
pressure above the strip.
We see that the increased wind
speed is, indeed, accompanied by a
reduced air pressure.
Can you imagine what would happen
if high-speed winds blew over the roofs
of buildings? If the roofs were weak, they
could be lifted and blown away. If you
have any such experience, share it with
your friends.
Let us try to understand how winds
are produced, how they bring rain and
how they can be destructive sometimes.

candle below one of the bags as shown
in the figure. Observe what happens.
Why is the balance of the bags
disturbed?
Does this activity indicate that warm
air rises up? As the warm air rises up,
it pushes the bag above the candle. Does
the disturbance of the balance suggest
that the warm air is lighter than the cold
air?
Can you now explain why smoke
always rises up?
Also, it is important to remember that
on heating the air expands and occupies
more space. When the same thing
occupies more space, it becomes lighter.
The warm air is, therefore, lighter than
the cold air. That is the reason that the
smoke goes up.
In nature there are several situations,
where warm air rises at a place. The air
pressure at that place is lowered. The
cold air from the surrounding areas
rushes in to fill its place. This sets up
convection in air, as you learnt in
Chapter 4.

The next activity is very interesting.
This will make you understand more
about hot air.

SCIENCE

(b) Uneven heating of land
and water

ed

You have read about the sea breeze and
the land breeze in Chapter 4.
In summer, near the equator the land
warms up faster and most of the time
the temperature of the land is higher
than that of water in the oceans. The
air over the land gets heated and rises.
This causes the winds to flow from the
oceans towards the land. These are
monsoon winds (Fig. 8.9).

regions in the 0–30 degrees latitude belt
on either side of the equator moves in.
These winds blow from the north and
the south towards the equator. At the
poles, the air is colder than that at
latitudes about 60 degrees. The warm
air at these latitudes rises up and the
cold wind from the polar regions rushes
in, to take its place. In this way, wind
circulation is set up from the poles to
the warmer latitudes, as shown in
Fig. 8.8.

The word monsoon is derived from the
Arabic word ‘mausam’, which means
‘season’.

In winter, the direction of the wind
flow gets reversed; it flows from the land
to the ocean (Fig. 8.10).

I want to know what these
winds do for us.

tt

I wonder why the winds shown
in the figure are not in the exact
north-south direction.

The winds would have flown in the
north-south direction from north to
south, or from south to north. A change
in direction is however, caused by the
rotation of the earth.
WINDS, STORMS AND CYCLONES

The winds from the oceans carry
water and bring rain. It is a part of the
water cycle.
The monsoon winds carry water
and it rains.
Clouds bring rain and give us
happiness. Farmers in our country
depend mainly on rains for their
harvests. There are many folk songs
associated with clouds and rain. Sing
and enjoy with your friends, if you know
such a song. Here is one for you.

However, it is not always a happy
ending. Rains often create problems.
Can you list some of the problems?
You can discuss the causes and
solutions of the problems with your
teacher and parents.
In nature itself there are certain
situations that can sometimes create
disasters and pose threat to humans,
animals and plant life.
Let’s study two such situations —
thunderstorms and cyclones.

AND

CYCLONES

The centre of a cyclone is a calm area.
It is called the eye of the storm. A large
cyclone is a violently rotating mass of
air in the atmosphere, 10 to 15 km
high. The diameter of the eye varies
from 10 to 30 km (Fig. 8.11). It is a
region free of clouds and has light
winds. Around this calm and clear eye
(Fig. 8.12), there is a cloud region of
about 150 km in size. In this region
there are high-speed winds (150–250
km/h) and thick clouds with heavy
rain. Away from this region the wind
speed gradually decreases. The
formation of a cyclone is a very
complex process. A model is shown in
Fig. 8.11.

Thunderstorms develop in hot, humid
tropical areas like India very frequently.
The rising temperatures produce strong
upward rising winds. These winds carry
water droplets upwards, where they
freeze, and fall down again. The swift
movement of the falling water droplets
along with the rising air create lightning
and sound. It is this event that we call a
thunderstorm. You will read about
lightning in higher classes.

8.5 THUNDERSTORMS

tt

If a storm is accompanied by
lightning, we must take the following
precautions:
 Do not take shelter under an
isolated tree. If you are in a forest
take shelter under a small tree. Do
not lie on the ground.
 Do not take shelter under an
umbrella with a metallic end.
 Do not sit near a window. Open
garages, storage sheds, metal
sheds are not safe places to take
shelter.
 A car or a bus is a safe place to
take shelter.
 If you are in water, get out and go
inside a building.

no

How a thunderstorm becomes
a cyclone
You know that water requires heat when
it changes from liquid to vapour state.
Does the water give back heat when
vapour condenses into liquid? Can you
recall any experience to support this?
WINDS, STORMS AND CYCLONES

Before cloud formation, water takes
up heat from the atmosphere to change
into vapour. When water vapour changes
back to liquid form as raindrops, this
heat is released to the atmosphere. The
heat released to the atmosphere warms
the air around. The air tends to rise and
causes a drop in pressure. More air
rushes to the centre of the storm. This
cycle is repeated. The chain of events
ends with the formation of a very
low-pressure system with very
high-speed winds revolving around it.
It is this weather condition that we call
a cyclone. Factors like wind speed,
wind direction, temperature and
humidity contribute to the development
of cyclones.

CYCLONES

BY

no

tt

Cyclones can be very destructive.
Strong winds push water towards the
shore even if the storm is hundreds of
kilometres away. These are the first
indications of an approaching cyclone.
The water waves produced by the wind
are so powerful that a person cannot
overcome them.
The low pressure in the eye lifts
water surface in the centre. The rising
water may be as high as 3–12 metres
88

(Fig. 8.13). It appears like a water-wall
moving towards the shore. As a result,
the seawater enters the low-lying coastal
areas, causing severe loss of life and
property. It also reduces the fertility of
the soil.
Continuous heavy rainfall may
further worsen the flood situation.
High-speed winds accompanying a
cyclone can damage houses, telephones
and other communication systems,
trees, etc., causing tremendous loss of
life and property.

to low pressure) and throws them out near the top.
Here are a few accounts of the survivors of tornados(from Discovery channel’s “Young Discovery
Series”).
“I saw the cloud coming and tried to take shelter
inside. But as soon as I reached for the doorknob,
the house took off into the sky. I was not hurt at
all.”
“After the storm we had to clean the debris from
the wheat fields. We picked up splintered boards
and tree branches as well as dead chickens with
their feathers blown off and rabbits looked like they
had been skinned.”
A tornado shelter is a room situated deep inside
or underground having no windows. Or otherwise
it is better to shut windows and take shelter under
a table, workbench, where debris cannot reach. One
has to bow down on knees protecting head and
neck using arms (Fig. 8.15).

WINDS, STORMS AND CYCLONES

Tornadoes: In our country
they are not very frequent. A
tornado is a dark funnel
shaped cloud that reaches
from the sky to the ground
(Fig. 8.16). Most of the
tornadoes are weak. A violent
tornado can travel at speeds
of about 300 km/h.
Tornadoes may form within
cyclones.
The whole coastline of
India is vulnerable to
cyclones, particularly the
east coast. The west coast of
India is less vulnerable to
cyclonic storms both in
terms of intensity and
frequency of the cyclones.

We should not ignore the warnings
issued by the meteorological
department through TV, radio, or
newspapers.
 We should —
make necessary arrangements to
shift the essential household goods,
domestic animals and vehicles, etc.
to safer places;
avoid driving on roads through
standing water, as floods may have
damaged the roads; and
keep ready the phone numbers of all
emergency services like police, fire
brigade, and medical centres.
Some other precautions, if you are
staying in a cyclone hit area —
 Do not drink water that could be
contaminated. Always store drinking
water for emergencies.
 Do not touch wet switches and fallen
power lines.
 Do not go out just for the sake of fun.
 Do not pressurise the rescue force
by making undue demands.
 Cooperate and help your neighbours
and friends.

We have learnt that all storms are lowpressure systems. Wind speed plays
an important role in the formation of
storms. It is, therefore, important to
measure the wind speed. The
instrument that measures the wind
speed is called an anemometer.

Air expands on heating and contracts on cooling.

Warm air rises up, whereas comparatively cooler air tends to sink towards
the earth’s surface.
As warm air rises, air pressure at that place is reduced and the cooler
air moves to that place.
The moving air is called wind.

Uneven heating on the earth is the main cause of wind movements.
Winds carrying water vapour bring rain.

High-speed winds and air pressure difference can cause cyclones.

Air around us exerts pressure.

It has become easier to monitor cyclones with the help of advance
technology like satellites and radars.

differently at home. Use two plastic bottles of the same size. Stretch one
balloon on the neck of each bottle. Keep one bottle in the sun and the
other in the shade. Record your observations. Compare these
observations and the result with those of Activity 8.5.

Fix the strips at the centre, putting one over the other so that they
make a plus (+) sign. Now fix the cups at the ends of the strips. Colour
the outer surface of one cup with a marker or a sketch pen. All the 4
cups should face in the same direction.

ed

Push a pin through the centre of the strips and attach the strips and
the cups to the eraser of the pencil. Check that the strips rotate freely
when you blow on the cups. Your anemometer is ready. Counting the
number of rotations per minute will give you an estimate of the speed of
the wind. To observe the changes in the wind speed, use it at different
places and different times of the day.

If you do not have a pencil with attached eraser you can use the tip of a
ball pen. The only condition is that the strips should rotate freely.

Remember that this anemometer will indicate only speed changes. It
will not give you the actual wind speed.

3. Collect articles and photographs from newspapers and magazines about
storms and cyclones. Make a story on the basis of what you learnt in
this chapter and the matter collected by you.
4. Suppose you are a member of a committee, which is responsible for
creating development plan of a coastal state. Prepare a short speech
indicating the measures to be taken to reduce the suffering of the people
caused by cyclones.

6. Take an aluminium tube about 15 cm
long and 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter. Cut
slice of a medium-sized potato about
2 cm thick. Insert the tube in the slice,
press it, and rotate it 2–3 times.
Remove the tube. You will find a piece
of potato fixed in the tube like a
piston head. Repeat the same process
with the other end of the tube. Now
you have the tube with both ends
closed by potato pieces with an air
column in between. Take a pencil with
one end unsharpened. Place this end
at one of the pieces of potato. Press it
suddenly to push the potato piece in
the tube. Observe what happens. The
