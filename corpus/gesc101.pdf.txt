utilisation by the body. The mode of
nutrition in which organisms make food
themselves from simple substances is
called autotrophic (auto = self; trophos
= nourishment) nutrition. Therefore,
plants are called autotrophs. Animals
and most other organisms take in ready
made food prepared by the plants. They
are called heterotrophs (heteros =
other).

n Class VI you learnt that food is
essential for all living organisms.
You also learnt that carbohydrates,
proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals are
components of food. These components
of food are necessary for our body and
are called nutrients.
All living organisms require food.
Plants can make their food themselves
but animals including humans cannot.
They get it from plants or animals that
eat plants. Thus, humans and animals
are directly or indirectly dependent on
plants.

Plants are the only organisms that can
prepare food for themselves by using
water, carbon dioxide and minerals. The
raw materials are present in their
surroundings.
The nutrients enable living
organisms to build their bodies, to grow,
to repair damaged parts of their bodies
and provide the energy to carry out life
processes. Nutrition is the mode of
taking food by an organism and its

Paheli wants to know why
our body cannot make food
from carbon dioxide, water
and minerals like plants do.

Now we may ask where the food
factories of plants are located: whether
food is made in all parts of a plant or
only in certain parts? How do plants
obtain the raw materials from the
surroundings? How do they transport
them to the food factories of the plants?

1.2 PHOTOSYNTHESIS — FOOD
MAKING PROCESS IN PLANTS

Leaves are the food factories of plants.
The synthesis of food in plants occurs
in leaves. Therefore, all the raw
materials must reach there. Water and
minerals present in the soil are absorbed
by the roots and transported to the

You have seen that buildings are made of bricks.
Similarly, the bodies of living organisms are
made of tiny units called cells. Cells can be seen
only under the microscope. Some organisms
are made of only one cell. The cell is enclosed by
a thin outer boundary, called the cell membrane.
Most cells have a distinct, centrally located
spherical structure called the nucleus (Fig. 1.1).
The nucleus is surrounded by a jelly-like
substance called cytoplasm.
leaves. Carbon dioxide from air is taken
in through the tiny pores present on the
surface of the leaves. These pores are
surrounded by ‘guard cells’. Such pores
are called stomata [Fig. 1.2 (c)].
Boojho wants to know how water
and minerals absorbed by roots
reach the leaves.

no
t

Water and minerals are transported
to the leaves by the vessels which run
like pipes throughout the root, the stem,
the branches and the leaves. They form
a continuous path or passage for the
nutrients to reach the leaf. You will learn
about transport of materials in plants
in Chapter 11.

Paheli wants to know what is so
special about the leaves that they
can synthesise food but other
parts of the plant cannot.

Fig. 1.1 Cell

The leaves have a green pigment
called chlorophyll. It helps leaves to
capture the energy of the sunlight. This
energy is used to synthesise (prepare)
food from carbon dioxide and water.
Since the synthesis of food occurs in the
presence of sunlight, it is called
photosynthesis (Photo: light; synthesis :
to combine). So we find that chlorophyll,
sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are
necessary to carry out the process of
photosynthesis. It is a unique process
on the earth. The solar energy is
captured by the leaves and stored in the
plant in the form of food. Thus, sun is
the ultimate source of energy for all
living organisms.
Can you imagine life on earth in the
absence of photosynthesis!
In the absence of photosynthesis
there would not be any food. The
survival of almost all living organisms
directly or indirectly depends upon the
food made by the plants. Besides,
oxygen which is essential for the survival
SCIENCE

Besides leaves, photosynthesis also takes place in other green parts of the
plant — in green stems and green branches. The desert plants have scale- or
spine-like leaves to reduce loss of water by transpiration. These plants have
green stems which carry out photosynthesis.

of all living organisms is produced
during photosynthesis. In the absence
of photosynthesis, life would be
impossible on the earth.
During photosynthesis, chlorophyll
containing cells of leaves (Fig. 1.2), in
the presence of sunlight, use carbon
dioxide and water to synthesise
carbohydrates (Fig. 1.3). The process
can be represented as an equation:

During the process oxygen is
released. The carbohydrates ultimately
get converted into starch. The presence
of starch in leaves indicates the
occurrence of photosynthesis. The
starch is also a carbohydrate.

process of photosynthesis. The
carbohydrates are made of carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen. These are used
to synthesise other components of food
such as proteins and fats. But proteins
are nitrogenous substances which
contain nitrogen. From where do the
plants obtain nitrogen?
Recall that nitrogen is present in
abundance in gaseous form in the air.
However, plants cannot absorb nitrogen
in this form. Soil has certain bacteria that
convert gaseous nitrogen into a usable
form and release it into the soil. These
soluble forms are absorbed by the plants
along with water. Also, you might have
seen farmers adding fertilisers rich in
nitrogen to the soil. In this way the
plants fulfil their requirements of
nitrogen along with the other
constituents. Plants can then synthesise
components of food other than
carbohydrates such as proteins and fats.

notebook.
The leaves other than green also have
chlorophyll. The large amount of red,
brown and other pigments mask the
green colour (Fig. 1.4). Photosynthesis
takes place in these leaves also.

You often see slimy, green patches
in ponds or in other stagnant water

the growth of organisms called algae.
Can you guess why algae are green in
colour? They contain chlorophyll which

also prepare their own food by
photosynthesis.

There are some plants which do not have

where do they derive nutrition? Like
humans and animals such plants
depend on the food produced by other
plants. They use the heterotrophic
mode of nutrition. Look at Fig. 1.5. Do

twining around the stem and branches
of a tree? This is a plant called Cuscuta

The apex of the leaf forms a lid which
can open and close the mouth of the
pitcher. Inside the pitcher there are hair
which are directed downwards. When
an insect lands in the pitcher, the lid
closes and the trapped insect gets
entangled into the hair. The insect is
digested by the digestive juices secreted
in the pitcher. Such insect-eating plants
are called insectivorous plants.
Is it possible that such plants do not
get all the required nutrients from the
soil in which they grow?

on which it is climbing. The plant on
which it climbs is called a host. Since it
deprives the host of valuable nutrients,
it is called a parasite. Are we and the
other animals also parasites on the
plants? You should think about it and
discuss with your teacher.

Boojho is confused. If the
pitcher plant is green and
carries out photosynthesis, then
why does it feed on insects?

Write down your observations in your
notebook. Most probably you will see
cotton-like threads spread on the piece
of bread.
These organisms are called fungi.
They have a different mode of nutrition.
They secrete digestive juices on the dead
and decaying matter and convert it into
a solution. Then they absorb the
nutrients from it. This mode of nutrition
in which organisms take in nutrients in
solution form from dead and decaying
matter is called saprotrophic nutrition.
Plants which use saprotrophic mode of
nutrition are called saprotrophs.
Fungi also grow on pickles, leather,
clothes and other articles that are left
in hot and humid weather for long time.

SCIENCE

Have you seen farmers spreading
manure or fertilisers in the fields, or
gardeners using them in lawns or in
pots? Do you know why they are added
to the soil?
You learnt that plants absorb
mineral nutrients from the soil. So, their
amounts in the soil keep on declining.
Fertilisers and manures contain plant
nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium,
phosphorous, etc. These nutrients need
to be added from time to time to enrich
the soil. We can grow plants and keep
them healthy if we can fulfil the nutrient
requirement of plants.
Usually crops require a lot of nitrogen
to make proteins. After the harvest, the
soil becomes deficient in nitrogen. You
learnt that though nitrogen gas is available
in plenty in the air, plants cannot use it
in the manner they can use carbon
dioxide. They need nitrogen in a soluble
form. The bacterium called Rhizobium can
take atmospheric nitrogen and convert it
into a soluble form. But Rhizobium cannot
make its own food. So it lives in the roots
of gram, peas, moong, beans and other
legumes and provides them with
nitrogen. Most of the pulses (dals) are
obtained from leguminous plants. In
return, the plants provide food and
shelter to the bacteria. They, thus, have

During the rainy season they spoil many
things. Ask your parents about the
menace of fungi in your house.
The fungal spores are generally
present in the air. When they land on
wet and warm things they germinate
and grow. Now, can you figure out how
we can protect our things from getting
spoiled?
Some organisms live together and
share shelter and nutrients. This is
called symbiotic relationship. For
example, certain fungi live in the roots
of trees. The tree provides nutrients to
the fungus and, in return, receives help
from it to take up water and nutrients
from the soil. This association is very
important for the tree.
In organisms called lichens, a
chlorophyll-containing partner, which is
an alga, and a fungus live together. The
