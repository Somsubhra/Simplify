REPRODUCTION

D

o you recall the processes of
digestion, circulation and
respiration which you have
studied in your previous classes? These
processes are essential for the survival
of every individual. You have also learnt
about the process of reproduction in
plants. Reproduction is essential for the
continuation of a species. Imagine what
would have happened if organisms had
not reproduced. You will realise that
reproduction is very important as it
ensures the continuation of similar
kinds of individuals, generation after
generation.
You have already learnt in your
previous class about reproduction in
plants. In this chapter, we shall learn
how reproduction takes place in
animals.

9.1 Modes of Reproduction

Just as in plants, there are two modes
by which animals reproduce. These are:
(i) Sexual reproduction, and (ii) Asexual
reproduction.

9.2 Sexual Reproduction
Try to recall reproduction in plants
which you studied in Class VII. You will
remember that plants that reproduce
sexually have male and female
reproductive parts. Can you name these
parts? In animals also, males and
females have different reproductive parts
or organs. Like plants, the reproductive
parts in animals also produce gametes
that fuse to form a zygote. It is the zygote
which develops into a new individual.
This type of reproduction beginning
from the fusion of male and female
gametes is called sexual reproduction.
Let us find out the reproductive parts

in humans and study the process of
reproduction in them.

sperm is a single cell with all the usual
cell components.

Male Reproductive Organs
The male reproductive organs include a
pair of testes (singular, testis), two sperm
ducts and a penis (Fig. 9.1). The testes
produce the male gametes called
sperms. Millions of sperms are produced
by the testes. Look at Fig. 9.2 which
shows the picture of a sperm. Though
sperms are very small in size, each has
a head, a middle piece and a tail. Does
it appear to be a single cell? Indeed, each

(Fig. 9.4). In human beings, a single
matured egg is released into the oviduct
by one of the ovaries every month.
Uterus is the part where development of
the baby takes place. Like the sperm,
an egg is also a single cell.

Boojho recalls that the size
of eggs in animals varies.
The egg may be very small
as in humans, much larger
as in hens. Ostrich egg is
the largest!

Fertilization

The first step in the process of
reproduction is the fusion of a sperm
and an ovum. When sperms come in
contact with an egg, one of the sperms
may fuse with the egg. Such fusion of
the egg and the sperm is called
fertilization (Fig. 9.5). During
fertilization, the nuclei of the sperm and
the egg fuse to form a single nucleus.
This results in the formation of a
fertilized egg or zygote (Fig. 9.6). Did

o
n

104

Fig. 9.6 : Zygote

you know that the zygote is the
beginning of a new individual?
The process of fertilization is the
meeting of an egg cell from the mother
and a sperm cell from the father. So,
the new individual inherits some
characteristics from the mother and
some from the father. Look at your
brother or sister. See if you can recognise
some characters in them similar to those
of your mother or your father.
Fertilization which takes place inside
the female body is called internal
fertilization. Internal fertilization
occurs in many animals including
humans, cows, dogs and hens.
SCIENCE

Have you heard of
test tube babies?
Boojho and Paheli’s teacher once told
them in the class that in some women
oviducts are blocked. These women
are unable to bear babies because
sperms cannot reach the egg for
fertilization. In such cases, doctors
collect freshly released egg and
sperms and keep them together for a
few hours for IVF or in vitro
fertilization (fertilization outside the
body). In case fertilization occurs, the
zygote is allowed to develop for about
a week and then it is placed in the
mother’s
uterus.
Complete
development takes place in the uterus
and the baby is born like any other
baby. Babies born through this
technique are called test-tube
babies. This term is actually
misleading because babies cannot
grow in test tubes.

female lays hundreds of eggs. Unlike
hen’s egg, frog’s egg is not covered by a
shell and it is comparatively very
delicate. A layer of jelly holds the eggs
together and provides protection to the
eggs (Fig. 9.7).

You will be surprised to know that
in many animals fertilization takes
place outside the body of the female.
In these animals, fertilization takes
place in water. Let us find out how
this happens.

Activity 9.1

Visit some ponds or slow-flowing
streams during spring or rainy
season. Look out for clusters of
fr og’s eggs floating in water.

During spring or rainy season, frogs
and toads move to ponds and slowflowing streams. When the male and
female come together in water, the
REPRODUCTION IN ANIMALS

d
e

Fig. 9.7 : Eggs of frog

As the eggs are laid, the male
deposits sperms over them. Each
sperm swims randomly in water with
the help of its long tail. The sperms
come in contact with the eggs. This
results in fertilization. This type of
fertilization in which the fusion of a
male and a female gamete takes place
outside the body of the female is called
external fertilization. It is very
common in aquatic animals such as
fish, starfish, etc.

Why do fish and
frogs lay eggs in
hundreds whereas a
hen lays only one
egg at a time?
105

How could a single cell
become such a big
individual?

Though these animals lay
hundreds of eggs and release
millions of sperms, all the eggs
do not get fertilized and develop
into new individuals.
This is because the eggs and
sperms get exposed to water
movement, wind and rainfall.
Also, there are other animals in
the pond which may feed
on eggs. Thus, production
of large number of eggs and
sperms is necessary to
ensure fertilization
of at least
a few of them.

Development of Embryo
Fertilization results in the formation of
zygote which begins to develop into an
embryo [Fig. 9.8(a)]. The zygote divides
repeatedly to give rise to a ball of cells
[Fig. 9.8(b)]. The cells then begin to form
groups that develop into different tissues
and organs of the body. This developing
structure is termed an embryo. The
embryo gets embedded in the wall of the
uterus for further development
[Fig. 9.8(c)].
The embryo continues to develop in
the uterus. It gradually develops the

period? After the chick is completely
developed it bursts open the egg shell.
In animals which undergo external
fertilization, development of the embryo
takes place outside the female body. The
embryos continue to grow within their
egg coverings. After the embryos develop,
the eggs hatch. You must have seen
numerous tadpoles swimming in ponds
and streams.
Viviparous and Oviparous Animals

s

We have learnt that some animals give
birth to young ones while some animals
lay eggs which later develop into young
ones. The animals which give birth to
young ones are called viviparous
animals. Those animals which lay eggs
are called oviparous animals. The
following activity will help you
understand better and differentiate
between viviparous and oviparous
animals.

Internal fertilization takes place in
hens also. But, do hens give birth to
babies like human beings and cows? You
know that they do not. Then, how are
chicks born? Let us find out.
Soon after fertilization, the zygote
divides repeatedly and travels down the
oviduct. As it travels down, many
protective layers are formed around it.
The hard shell that you see in a hen’s
egg is one such protective layer.
After the hard shell is formed around
the developing embryo, the hen finally
lays the egg. The embryo takes about 3
weeks to develop into a chick. You must
have seen the hen sitting on the eggs to
provide sufficient warmth. Did you know
that development of the chick takes
place inside the egg shell during this

Activity 9.2

Try to collect eggs of the following
organisms – frog, lizard, butterfly
or moth, hen and crow or any other
bird. Were you able to collect eggs
of all of them? Make drawings of the
eggs that you have collected.

The eggs of a few animals are easy
to collect because their mothers lay
them outside their bodies. These
animals from which you have collected
the eggs are examples of oviparous
animals. But you would not be able to
collect the eggs of a dog, cow or cat.
This is because they do not lay eggs.
The mother gives birth to the young
ones. These are examples of viviparous
animals.
107

Can you now give some more
examples of viviparous and oviparous
animals?
Young Ones to Adults
The new individuals which are born or
hatched from the eggs continue to grow
till they become adults. In some
animals, the young ones may look very
different from the adults. Recall the life
cycle of the silkworm (egg → larva or
caterpillar → pupa → adult) you studied
in Class VII. Frog is another such
example (Fig. 9.10).
Observe the different stages of frog
starting from the egg to the adult stage.
We find that there are three distinct
stages, that is, egg → tadpole (larva) →
adult. Don’t the tadpoles look so
different from the adults? Can you
imagine that these tadpoles would some
day become frogs? Similarly, the
caterpillar or the pupa of silkworm looks
very different from the adult moth. The

features that are present in the adult are
not found in these young ones. Then what
happens to the tadpoles or caterpillars
thereafter?
You must have seen a beautiful moth
emerging out of the cocoon. In the case of
tadpoles, they transform into adults
capable of jumping and swimming. The
transformation of the larva into an adult
through drastic changes is called
metamorphosis. What about the changes
that we observe in our body as we grow?
Do you think we too undergo
metamorphosis? In human beings, body
parts similar to those present in the adults
are present from the time of the birth.

In each hydra, there may be one or
more bulges. These bulges are the
developing new individuals and they are
called buds. Recall the presence of buds
in yeast. In hydra too the new individuals
develop as outgrowths from a single
parent. This type of reproduction in
which only a single parent is involved is
called asexual reproduction. Since new
individuals develop from the buds in
hydra, this type of asexual reproduction
is called budding.
Another method of asexual
reproduction is observed in the
microscopic organism, amoeba. Let us
see how this happens.
You have already learnt about the
structure of amoeba. You will recall that
amoeba is a single-celled organisms [Fig.
9.12(a)]. It begins the process of
reproduction by the division of its
nucleus into two nuclei [Fig. 9.12(b)].
This is followed by division of its body
into two, each part receiving a nucleus
[Fig. 9.12(c)]. Finally, two amoebae are
produced from one parent amoeba [Fig.
9.12(d)]. This type of asexual

reproduction in which an animal
reproduces by dividing into two
individuals is called binary fission.
Apart from budding and binary fission,

there are other methods by which a
single parent reproduces the young
ones. You will study about these in your
higher classes.

Story of Dolly, the Clone
Cloning is the production of an exact copy of a cell, any other living part, or a
complete organism. Cloning of an animal was successfully performed for the first
time by Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh,
Scotland. They cloned successfully a sheep named Dolly [Fig. 9.13 (c)]. Dolly was
born on 5th July 1996 and was the first mammal to be cloned.

Fig. 9.13

During the process of cloning Dolly, a cell was collected from the mammary gland
of a female Finn Dorsett sheep [Fig. 9.13 (a)]. Simultaneously, an egg was obtained
from a Scottish blackface ewe [Fig. 9.13 (b)]. The nucleus was removed from the
egg. Then, the nucleus of the mammary gland cell from the Finn Dorsett sheep
was inserted into the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe whose nucleus had been
removed. The egg thus produced was implanted into the Scottish blackface ewe.
Development of this egg followed normally and finally Dolly was born. Though
Dolly was given birth by the Scottish blackface ewe, it was found to be absolutely
identical to the Finn Dorsett sheep from which the nucleus was taken. Since the
nucleus from the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe was removed, Dolly did not
show any character of the Scottish blackface ewe. Dolly was a healthy clone of
the Finn Dorsett sheep and produced several offspring of her own through normal
sexual means. Unfortunately, Dolly died on 14th February 2003 due to a certain
lung disease.
Since Dolly, several attempts have been made to produce cloned mammals.
However, many die before birth or die soon after birth. The cloned animals are
many-a-time found to be born with severe abnormalities.

There are two modes by which animals
reproduce. These are: (i) Sexual reproduction,
and (ii) Asexual reproduction.
Reproduction resulting from the fusion of male
and female gametes is called sexual
reproduction.
The reproductive organs in the female include
ovaries, oviducts and uterus.
The reproductive organs in male include
testes, sperm ducts and penis.
The ovary produces female gametes called ova
and the testes produce male gametes called
sperms.
The fusion of ovum and sperm is called
fertilization. The fertilized egg is called a zygote.
Fertilization that takes place inside the female
body is called internal fertilization. This is
observed in human beings and other animals
such as hens, cows and dogs.
Fertilization that takes place outside the female
body is called external fertilization. This is
observed in frogs, fish, starfish, etc.
The zygote divides repeatedly to give rise to an

Did You Know?

An interesting organisation is observed in a honey bee hive, a colony of several
thousand bees. Only one bee in the colony lays eggs. This bee is called the
queen bee. All other female bees are worker bees. Their main job is to build the
hive, look after the young and feed the queen bee adequately to keep her
healthy so that she could lay eggs. A queen bee lays thousands of eggs. The
fertilized eggs hatch into females, while the unfertilized eggs give rise to males,
called drones. It is the job of the worker bees to maintain the temperature of
the hive around 35ºC to incubate the eggs.
