o you remember the things that
you were asked to pack when
you were heading for a hill
station? When the sky is cloudy, your
parents insist that you carry an
umbrella. Have you heard elders in your
family discuss the weather before
planning a family function? You must
have also heard the experts discussing
the weather before the start of a game.
Have you ever wondered why? The
weather may have a profound effect on
the game. It has a profound effect on
our lives. Many of our daily activities are
planned based on the weather predicted
for that day. There are daily reports of
the weather on the television and
radio and in the newspapers. But do you
know what this weather really is?
In this chapter, we will study about
the weather and climate. We will also
see how different forms of life are
adapted to the climate of their habitat.

In Fig. 7.1 a sample of weather report
from a newspaper is given.
We find that the daily weather report
carries infor mation about the
temperature, humidity and rainfall
during the past 24 hours. It also
predicts the weather for the day.
Humidity, as you might know, is a
measure of the moisture in air.

I wonder who prepares
these reports!

The weather reports are prepared by
the Meteorological Department of the
Government. This department collects
data on temperature, wind, etc., and
makes the weather prediction.

Activity 7.1

Cut out the weather reports of the last
week from any newspaper. If you do not
get a newspaper at home borrow from
your neighbours or friends and copy
these reports in your notebook. You can
also collect weather reports from a
library. Paste all the cut-outs on a white
sheet or on a chart paper.
Now record the information from the
weather reports collected by you in
Table 7.1. The first row is just a sample.
Fill all the columns according to the data
in the chart that you have prepared.

*(Rainfall may not be recorded for all the days since it may not rain everyday. Leave
the space for rainfall blank if the data is not available.)

Rainfall is measured by an
instrument called the rain gauge. It
is basically a measuring cylinder with
a funnel on top to collect rainwater.

tt

Do all the seven days have the same
maximum and minimum temperatures,
humidity and rainfall? The maximum
and minimum temperatures recorded
may be the same for some of the days.
However, all the parameters are not the
same on any two days. Over a week there
may be considerable variation. The dayto-day condition of the atmosphere
at a place with respect to the
temperature, humidity, rainfall, windspeed, etc., is called the weather at that
place. The temperature, humidity, and
other factors are called the elements of
the weather. The weather of a place
changes day after day and week after
week. That is why we often say, “today’s

weather is too humid”, or “the weather
was warm last week”.
The weather is such a complex
phenomenon that it can vary over very
short periods of time. It can happen
sometimes that it is sunny in the
morning, but suddenly clouds appear
from nowhere and it starts raining
heavily. Or, a heavy rain may vanish in
a matter of minutes and give way to
bright sunshine. You must have had
several such experiences. Try to recall
any such experience and share it with
your friends. Since weather is such a
complex phenomenon, it is not easy to
predict.
Look at the graph given below which
shows the maximum temperature
recorded during 03 August 2006 to 09
August 2006 at Shillong, Meghalaya
(Fig. 7.2).

As it is clear from any weather report,
the
maximum
and
minimum
temperatures are recorded every day. Do
you know how these temperatures are
recorded. In Chapter 4 you have learnt

I wonder why weather
changes so frequently!

tt

What is the source of weather
in the first place?

that there are special thermometers for
this purpose, called maximum and
minimum thermometers. Can you
guess when during the day we have the
maximum temperature and when the
minimum?
The maximum temperature of the day
occurs generally in the afternoon while
the minimum temperature occurs
generally in the early morning. Can you
now understand why in summers we feel
so miserable in the afternoon and
comparatively comfortable early in the
morning?

no

All changes in the weather are caused by the sun. The sun is a huge sphere of
hot gases at a very high temperature. The distance of the sun from us is very
large. Even then the energy sent out by the sun is so huge that it is the source of
all heat and light on the earth. So, the sun is the primary source of energy that
causes changes in the weather. Energy absorbed and reflected by the earth’s
surface, oceans and the atmosphere play important roles in determining the
weather at any place. If you live near the sea, you would have realised that the
weather at your place is different from that of a place in a desert, or near a mountain.

Meteorologists record the weather every
day. The records of the weather have
been preserved for the past several
decades. These help us to determine the
weather pattern at a place. The average
weather pattern taken over a long
time, say 25 years, is called the
climate of the place. If we find that
the temperature at a place is high most

of the time, then we say that the climate
of that place is hot. If there is also heavy
rainfall on most of the days in the same
place, then we can say that the climate
of that place is hot and wet.
In Table 7.2 and 7.3, we have given
the climatic condition at two places in
India. The mean temperature for a given
month is found in two steps. First we
find the average of the temperatures
recorded during the month. Second, we
calculate the average of such average
temperatures over many years. That
gives the mean temperature. The two
places are: Srinagar in Jammu and
Kashmir, and Thiruvananthapuram in
Kerala.

ed

What about the times of sunrise and
sunset? You know that in winters it
becomes dark early and you do not get
much time to play. Are the days shorter
in winter than in summer? Try to find
it out yourself by completing the project
given at the end of the chapter.

habitats. As examples of adaptation of
animals to climatic conditions, we
discuss only animals living in polar
regions and tropical rainforests.
As the name suggests, the polar
regions are situated near the poles, i.e.,
north pole and south pole.
Some well-known countries that
belong to the polar regions are Canada,
Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden,
Finland, Alaska in U.S.A. and Siberian
region of Russia.
Examples of some countries where
the tropical rainforests are found are
India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil,
Republic of Congo, Kenya, Uganda, and
Nigeria.

By looking at Tables 7.2 and 7.3 we
can easily see the difference in the
climate of Jammu & Kashmir and
Kerala. We can see that Kerala is very
hot and wet in comparison to Jammu
& Kashmir, which has a moderately hot
and wet climate for a part of the year.
Similar data for the western region
of India, for example Rajasthan, will
show that the temperature is high
during most part of the year. But during
winter, which lasts only for a few
months, the temperature is quite low.
This region receives very little
rainfall. This is the typical desert
climate. It is hot and dry. The northeastern India receives rain for a major
part of the year. Therefore, we can say
that the climate of the north-east is wet.

7.3 CLIMATE AND ADAPTATION

no

tt

Climate has a profound effect on all
living organisms.
Animals are adapted to survive in the
conditions in which they live. Animals
living in very cold and hot climate must
possess special features to protect
themselves against the extreme cold or
heat. Recall from Chapter 9 of your
Class VI science book the definition of
adaptation. Features and habits that
help animals to adapt to their
surroundings are a result of the process
of evolution.
In Chapter 9 you will learn about the
effect of weather and climate on soil. Here
we will study the effect of climate on
animals only. In Class VI, you have read
about adaptations of animals to certain

Activity 7.2

Take an outline map of the world. Mark
the polar regions in blue. Similarly,
mark the tropical regions in red.

(i) The polar regions

The polar regions present an extreme
climate. These regions are covered with
snow and it is very cold for most part of
the year. For six months the sun does
not set at the poles while for the other
six months the sun does not rise. In
winters, the temperature can be as low
as –37°C. Animals living there have
adapted to these severe conditions. Let
us see how they are adapted by
considering the examples of polar bears
and penguins.
Polar bears have white fur so that
they are not easily visible in the snowy
white background. It protects them from
SCIENCE

ed

Another well-known animal living in
the polar regions is the penguin
(Fig. 7.4). It is also white and merges
well with the white background. It also
has a thick skin and a lot of fat to protect
it from cold. You may have seen pictures
of penguins huddled together. This they
do to keep warm. Recall how warm you
feel when you are in a hall full of people.

their predators. It also helps them in
catching their prey. To protect them
from extreme cold, they have two thick
layers of fur. They also have a layer of
fat under their skin. In fact, they are so
well-insulated that they have to move
slowly and rest often to avoid getting
overheated.
Physical activities on warm days
necessitate cooling. So, the polar bear
goes for swimming. It is a good
swimmer. Its paws are wide and large,
which help it not only to swim well but
also walk with ease in the snow. While
swimming under water, it can close its
nostrils and can remain under water for
long durations. It has a strong sense of
smell so that it can catch its prey
for food. We can understand the
adaptations of polar bears with the help
of the flow chart shown in Fig. 7.3.

Like polar bears, penguins are also good
swimmers. Their bodies are streamlined
and their feet have webs, making them
good swimmers (Fig. 7.5).
Other animals living in the polar
regions are many types of fishes, musk
oxen, reindeers, foxes, seals, whales,
and birds. It is to be noted that while
fish can remain under cold water for

ed

long, birds must remain warm to
survive. They migrate to warmer regions
when winter sets in. They come back
after the winter is over. You know
probably that India is one of the
destinations of many of these birds. You
must have seen or heard about the
Siberian crane that comes from Siberia
to places like Bharatpur in Rajasthan
and Sultanpur in Haryana, and some

Do fishes and butterflies
also migrate like birds?

Did you know?

tt

Some migratory birds travel as much as 15000 km to escape the extreme climatic
conditions at home. Generally they fly high where the wind flow is helpful and
the cold conditions allow them to disperse the heat generated by their flight
muscles. But how these birds travel to the same place year after year is still a
mystery. It seems that these birds have a built–in sense of direction and know in
which direction to travel. Some birds probably use landmarks to guide them. Many
birds may be guided by the sun during the day and stars at night. There is some
evidence that birds may use the magnetic field of the earth to find direction. And
it is not only birds that migrate; mammals, many types of fish and insects are
also known to migrate seasonally in search of more hospitable climates.

The tropical region has generally a hot
climate because of its location around
the equator. Even in the coldest month
the temperature is generally higher than
about 15°C. During hot summers, the
temperature may cross 40°C. Days and
nights are almost equal in length
throughout the year. These regions get
plenty of rainfall. An important feature
of this region is the tropical rainforests.
T ropical rainforests are found in
Western Ghats and Assam in India,
Southeast Asia, Central America and
Central Africa. Because of continuous
warmth and rain, this region supports
wide variety of plants and animals. The
major types of animals living in the
rainforests are monkeys, apes, gorillas,
tigers, elephants, leopards, lizards,
snakes, birds and insects.
Let us read about the adaptations of
these animals to a hot, humid climate.
The climatic conditions in rainforests
are highly suitable for supporting an
enormous number and a variety of
animals.
Since the numbers are large, there
is intense competition for food and
shelter. Many animals are adapted to
living on the trees. Red-eyed frog
(Fig. 7.7) has developed sticky pads on
its feet to help it climb trees on which it
lives. To help them live on the trees,
monkeys (Fig. 7.8) have long tails for
grasping branches. Their hands and feet

Fig. 7.8 A new world monkey

are such that they can easily hold on to
the branches.
As there is competition for food, some
animals are adapted to get food not
easily reachable. A striking example is
that of the bird Toucan (Fig. 7.9), which
possesses a long, large beak. This helps
a toucan to reach the fruits on branches
which are otherwise too weak to support
its weight.
Many tropical animals have sensitive
hearing, sharp eyesight, thick skin and
a skin colour which helps them to
camouflage by blending with the
surroundings. This is to protect them
from predators. For example, big cats

(Fig. 7.11). It has adapted to the
conditions of rainforests in many
remarkable ways. Look at its trunk. It
uses it as a nose because of which it
has a strong sense of smell. The trunk
is also used by it for picking up food.
Moreover, its tusks are modified teeth.
These can tear the bark of trees that
elephant loves to eat. So, the elephant
is able to handle the competition for food
rather well. Large ears of the elephant
help it to hear even very soft sounds.
They also help the elephant to keep cool
in the hot and humid climate of the
rainforest.

(lions and tigers) have thick skins and
sensitive hearing.
The lion-tailed macaque (also called
Beard ape) lives in the rainforests of
Western Ghats (Fig. 7.10). Its most
outstanding feature is the silver-white
mane, which surrounds the head from
the cheeks down to its chin. It is a good
climber and spends a major part of its
life on the tree. It feeds mainly on fruits.
It also eats seeds, young leaves, stems,
flowers and buds. This beard ape also
searches for insects under the bark of
the trees. Since it is able to get sufficient
food on the trees, it rarely comes down
on the ground.

What you have learnt
The day-to-day condition of the atmosphere at a place with respect to
the temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind-speed, etc., is called the
weather at that place.



The weather is generally not the same on any two days and week after
week.



The maximum temperature of the day occurs generally in the afternoon
while the minimum temperature occurs in the early morning.



The times of sunrise and sunset also change during the year.

The tropical and the polar regions are the two regions of the earth,
which have severe climatic conditions.
Animals are adapted to the conditions in which they live.

The polar regions are very cold throughout the year. The sun does not
set for six months in a year and in the other six months it does not rise.

Animals in the polar region are adapted to the extremely cold climate by
having some special characteristics such as white fur, strong sense of
smell, a layer of fat under the skin, wide and large paws for swimming
and walking, etc.
Migration is another means to escape the harsh, cold conditions.

Because of the hospitable climatic conditions huge populations of plants
and animals are found in the tropical rainforests.

Animals in the tropical rainforests are adapted such that they eat
different kinds of food to overcome the competition for food and shelter.

Some adaptations of animals living in the tropical rainforests include
living on the trees, development of strong tails, long and large beaks,
bright colours, sharp patterns, loud voice, diet of fruits, sensitive hearing,
sharp eyesight, thick skin, ability to camouflage in order to protect
themselves from predators, etc.
