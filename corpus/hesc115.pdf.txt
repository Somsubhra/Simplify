SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA
In Class VII you read about winds,
storms and cyclones. You learnt that
cyclones can cause a lot of damage to
human life and property. You also
learnt that we can protect ourselves from
these destructive phenomena to some
extent. In this chapter we shall discuss
two other destructive natural
phenomena. These are lightning and
earthquakes. We shall also discuss what
steps we can take to minimise
destruction
caused

these
phenomena.

15.1 Lightning

You might have seen sparks on a
electric pole when wires become loose.
This phenomenon is quite common
when a wind is blowing and shacking
the wires. You might also have seen
sparks when a plug is loose in its
socket. Lightning is also an electric
spark, but on a huge scale.
In ancient times people did not
understand the cause of these sparks.
They were, therefore, afraid of lightning
and thought that the wrath of gods was
visiting them. Now, of course, we
understand that lightning is caused by
the accumulation of charges in the
clouds. We need not be afraid of
lightning, but we have to take

The Sparks that the Greeks Knew
About

The ancient Greeks knew as early as
600 B.C. that when amber (amber is a
kind of resin) was rubbed with fur, it
attracted light objects such as hair. You
might have seen that when you take
off woollen or polyester clothes, your
hair stands on ends. If you take off
these clothes in the dark, you see even
a spark and hear crackling sound. In
1752 Benjamin Franklin, an American
scientist, showed that lightning and the
spark from your clothes are essentially
the same phenomena. However, this
realisation took 2000 years.

I wonder why they took so
many years to realise the
similarity.

Scientific discoveries are a
result of hardwork by many
people. It can sometime takes
a long time.

We shall now study some properties
of electric charges. We shall also see how
they are related to the lightning in the
sky.

Let us perform some activities to
understand the nature of electric
charges. But recall first what you might
have played as a game. When you rub
a plastic scale on your dry hair, the
scale can attract very small pieces of
paper.

15.2 Charging by rubbing

When a plastic refill is rubbed with
polythene, it acquires a small electric
charge. Similarly, when a plastic comb
is rubbed with dry hair, it acquires a
small charge. These objects are called
charged objects. In the process of
charging the refill and the plastic comb,
polythene and hair also get charged.

d
e

Let’s try to charge some other
objects that are familiar to you.

Activity 15.1
Take a used ballpen refill and rub
it vigorously with a piece of
polythene. Bring it close to small
pieces of paper. Take care not to
touch the rubbed end of the refill
with your hand or with a metallic
object. Repeat the activity with small
pieces of dry leaf, husk and mustard
seeds. Record your observations.

close to the charged refill. Be careful
not to touch the charged end with

together the charged objects that
were made of the same material.
What happens if two charged objects
made of different materials are
brought close to each other? Let’s
find out.

Let’s summarise the observations:
A charged balloon repelled a charged
balloon.
A charged refill repelled a charged
refill.
But a charged balloon attracted a
charged refill.
Does it indicate that the charge on
the balloon is of a different kind from
the charge on the refill? Can we say
then, that there are two kinds of
SCIENCE

charges? Can we also say that the
charges of the same kind repel each
other, while charges of different kind
attract each other?
It is a convention to call the charge
acquired by a glass rod when it is
rubbed with silk as positive. The
other kind of charge is said to be
negative.
It is observed that when a charged
glass rod is brought near a charged
plastic straw rubbed with polythene
there is attraction between the two.
What do you think would be the kind
of charge on the plastic straw? Your
guess, that the plastic straw would carry
a negative charge is correct.
The electrical charges generated by
rubbing are static. They do not move by
themselves. When charges move, they
constitute an electric current. You have
been reading about electric current since
Class VI. The current in a circuit which
makes a bulb glow, or the current that
makes a wire hot, is nothing but a
motion of charges.

Observe what happens. Is there any
effect on the foil strips? Do they
repel each other or attract each
other? Touch now, other charged
bodies with the end of the paper clip.
Do foil strips behave in the same
way in all cases? Can this apparatus
be used to detect whether a body is
charged or not? Can you explain
why the foil strips repel each other?

15.4 Transfer of Charge
Activity 15.4

Take an empty jam bottle. Take a
piece of cardboard slightly bigger in
size than the mouth of the bottle.
Pierce a hole in it so that a metal
paper clip could be inserted. Open
out paper clip as shown in Fig. 15.4.
Cut two strips of aluminium foil
about 4 cm × 1 cm each. Hang them
on the paper clip as shown. Insert
the paper clip in the cardboard lid
so that it is perpendicular to it (Fig.
15.4). Charge a refill and touch it

o
n

SOME NATURAL PHENOMENA

The aluminium foil strips receive the
same charge from the charged refill
through the paper clip (remember that
metals are good conductors of
electricity). The strips carrying similar
charges repel each other and they
become wide open. Such a device can
be used to test whether an object is
carrying charge or not. This device is
known as electroscope.
Thus, we find that electrical charge
can be transferred from a charged object
to another through a metal conductor.
Touch the end of the paper clip gently
with hand and you will find a change in
189

the foil strips. They come back to their
original state. Repeat charging of foil
strips and touching the paper clip. Every
time you will find that the foil strips
collapse as soon as you touch the
paperclip with hand. Why does it
happen? The reason is that the foil strips
lose charge to the earth through your
body. We say that the foil strips are
discharged. The process of transfering
of charge from a charged object to the
earth is called earthing.

You learnt in Class VII that during
the development of a thunderstorm, the
air currents move upward while the
water droplets move downward. These
vigorous movements cause separation
of charges. By a process, not yet
completely understood, the positive
charges collect near the upper edges of
the clouds and the negative charges
accumulate near the lower edges. There
is accumulation of positive charges near
the ground also. When the magnitude
of the accumulated charges becomes very
large, the air which is normally a poor
conductor of electricity, is no longer able
to resist their flow. Negative and positive
charges meet, producing streaks of
bright light and sound. We see streaks
as lightning (Fig. 15.5). The process is
called an electric discharge.

rubbing.

SCIENCE

The process of electric discharge can
occur between two or more clouds, or
between clouds and the earth. Today we
need not get frightened by lightning like
the ancient people did. Now we
understand the basic phenomenon.
Scientists are trying hard to improve our
understanding. However, lightning
strike could destroy life and property. It
is, therefore, necessary to take measures
to protect ourselves.

Instead, squat low on the ground. Place

you are safe inside with windows and
doors of the vehicle shut.

Outside
Open vehicles, like motorbikes, tractors,
construction machinery, open cars are
not safe. Open fields, tall trees, shelters
in parks, elevated places do not protect
us from lightning strokes.
Carrying umbrella is not a good idea
at all during thunderstorms.
If in a forest, take shelter under
shorter trees.
If no shelter is available and you are
in an open field, stay far away from all
trees. Stay away from poles or other

Inside the house
Lightning can strike telephone cords,
electrical wires and metal pipes (Do you
remember, lightning is an electrical
discharge?). During a thunderstorm
contact with these should be avoided. It
is safer to use mobile phones and
cordless phones. However, it is not wise
to call up a person who is receiving your
phone through a wired phone.
Bathing should be avoided during
thunderstorms to avoid contact with
running water.
Electrical appliances like computers,
TVs, etc., should be unplugged. Electrical
lights can remain on. They do not cause
any harm.

Lightning Conductors

15.7 Earthquakes

Lightning Conductor is a device used
to protect buildings from the effect of
lightning. A metallic rod, taller than the
building, is installed in the walls of the
building during its construction. One
end of the rod is kept out in the air and
the other is buried deep in the ground
(Fig. 15.7). The rod provides easy route
for the transfer of electric charge to the
ground.
The metal columns used during
construction, electrical wires and water
pipes in the buildings also protect us to
an extent. But do not touch them during
a thunderstorm.

You just learnt about thunderstorm and
lightning. In Class VII you learnt about
cyclones. These natural phenomena can
cause large scale destruction of human
life and property. Fortunately, these
phenomena can be predicted to some
extent. The weather department can
warn about a thunderstorm developing
in some area.
If a thunderstorm occurs there is
always a possibility of lightning and
cyclones accompanying it. So, we get
time to take measures to protect
ourselves from the damage caused by
these phenomena.

There is, however, one natural
phenomenon which we are not yet able
to predict. It is an earthquake. It can
cause damage to human life and
property on a huge scale.
A major earthquake occurred in India
on 8 th October 2005 in Uri and
Tangdhar towns of North Kashmir (Fig.

occurred on 26th January 2001 in Bhuj

Earthquakes occur all the time, all over
the earth. They are not even noticed.
Major earthquakes are much less
frequent. They can cause immense
damage to buildings, bridges, dams and
people. There can be a great loss to life
and property. The earthquakes can
cause floods, landslides and tsunamis.
A major tsunami occurred in the Indian
Ocean on 26th December 2004. All the
coastal areas around the ocean suffered
huge losses.

What could cause a
disturbance inside
the earth?

Now we know that the tremors are
caused by the disturbance deep down
inside the uppermost layer of the earth
called the crust (Fig. 15.9).

are caused by the movement of earth’s
plates.
Since earthquakes are caused by the
movement of plates, the boundaries of
the plates are the weak zones where
earthquakes are more likely to occur.
The weak zones are also known as
seismic or fault zones. In India, the
areas most threatened are Kashmir,
Western and Central Himalayas, the
whole of North-East, Rann of Kutch,
Rajasthan and the Indo – Gangetic
Plane. Some areas of South India also
fall in the danger zone (Fig. 15.12).

The power of an earthquake is
expressed in terms of a magnitude on a
scale called Richter scale. Really

magnitudes higher than 7 on the

earthquakes had magnitudes greater

The tremors produce waves on the surface of the earth. These are called seismic
waves. The waves are recorded by an instrument called the seismograph
(Fig. 15.13). The instrument is simply a vibrating rod, or a pendulum, which
starts vibrating when tremors occur. A pen is attached to the vibrating system.
The pen records the seismic waves on a paper which moves under it. By studying
these waves, scientists can construct a complete map of the earthquake, as shown
in Fig. 15.14. They can also estimate
its power to cause destruction.

Like many other scales in science (decibel is another example), Richter scale is
not linear. This means that an earthquake of magnitude 6 does not have one and
half times the destructive energy of an earthquake of magnitude 4. In fact, an
increase of 2 in magnitude means 1000 times more destructive energy. For
example, an earthquake of magnitude 6 has thousand times more destructive
energy than an earthquake of magnitude 4.

Protection against Earthquakes

We know from the earlier pages that
earthquakes cannot be predicted. We
have also seen that they can be highly
destructive. It is, therefore, important
that we take necessary precautions to
protect ourselves all the time. People
living in seismic zones, where the
earthquakes are more likely to occur,
196

have to be specially prepared. First of
all, the buildings in these zones should
be designed so that they can withstand
major tremors. Modern building
technology can make it possible.
It is advisable to make the structure
simple so that it is ‘Quake Safe’.
Consult qualified architects and
structural engineers.
SCIENCE

In highly seismic areas, the use of
mud or timber is better than the
heavy construction material. Keep
roofs as light as possible. In case
the structure falls, the damage will
not be heavy.
It is better if the cupboards and
shelves are fixed to the walls, so that
they do not fall easily.
Be careful where you hang wall
clocks, photo-frames, water heaters
etc., so that in the event of an
earthquake, they do not fall on
people.
Since some buildings may catch fire
due to an earthquake, it is necessary
that all buildings, especially tall
buildings, have fire fighting
equipment in working order.
The Central Building Research
Institute, Roorkee, has developed
knowhow to make quake proof houses.

In the event that an earthquake does
strike, take the following steps to protect
yourself:
1. If you are at home:
Take shelter under a table and stay
there till shaking stops.
Stay away from tall and heavy objects
that may fall on you.
If you are in bed, do not get up.
Protect your head with a pillow.
