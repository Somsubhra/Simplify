Forests: Our Lifeline

O

“This is because the forests serve as
green lungs and water purifying systems
in nature”, Prof Ahmad explained. The
children were confused. Prof Ahmad
realised that the children had not visited
a forest. The children also wanted to
know more about the forest, so they
decided to visit it with Prof Ahmad.

ne evening Boojho entered the
park with an elderly person. He
introduced him to his friends.
Prof Ahmad was a scientist working in
the university. The children started
playing while Prof Ahmad sat on a
bench in the corner. He was tired as he
had participated in the golden jubilee
celebrations of the town. After a while,
the children also came and sat around
him. They wanted to know about the
celebrations. Prof Ahmad told them that
after the cultural programme, the
senior people discussed the town’s
unemployment problem. A plan was
proposed to put up a factory by clearing
an area of the forest just outside the
town. This would give the increasing
population of the town a chance to get
jobs. The children were very surprised
when Prof Ahmad told them that many
people had objected to this idea.

17.1 VISIT

TO A

FOREST

One Sunday morning, the children
packed a few things like a knife, a hand
lens, a stick, a notebook and walked
together through a forest trail near a
village. On their way, they met Tibu, a
young boy of their age group, of nearby
village, who was taking cattle for grazing
along with his aunt. He was very agile,
running here and there to keep the herd
together. When he saw the children,
Tibu also started walking along with
them, while his aunt went on a different
path. As soon as they entered the forest
Tibu raised his hand and signalled them
to keep quiet because noise could
disturb the animals living in the forest.
Tibu then took them to a place at a
height to show them the broad view of
the forest. Children were surprised
because they could not see any land
(Fig. 17.1). The different treetops had
formed green cover over the land. However,
the cover was not uniformly green. The

environment was peaceful and a cool
breeze was blowing. This made children
quite fresh and happy.
While coming down, they got excited
on hearing a sudden sound of birds and
some noise from the top branches of the
trees. Tibu told them to relax since it
was a normal phenomenon here.
Because of the children’s presence, some
monkeys had climbed higher up on the
trees where they disturbed the birds.
Animals often give this type of warning
call to alert other animals. Tibu also told
that many other animals like boar,
bison, jackals, porcupine, elephants live
in the deeper areas of the forest
(Fig. 17.2). Prof Ahmad cautioned
children that they should not go deep
into the forest.
Boojho and Paheli remembered that
they have studied about forests as

an example of a habitat in Class VI
(Fig. 17.3). They could see now how the
forest provides a home for many animals
and plants.

The land where the children were
walking was uneven and covered with
many trees. Tibu helped them to identify
sal, teak, semal, sheesham, neem,
palash, fig, khair, amla, bamboo,
kachnar (Fig. 17.4). Prof Ahmad pointed
out that there are several other trees,
shrubs, herbs and grasses in the forest.
The trees were also covered with different

You might have many wooden items
on your list like plywood, fuel wood,
boxes, paper, matchsticks, and
furniture. Do you know that gum, oils,
spices, fodder for animals and medicinal
plants are also some of the products
which we get from the forest (Fig. 17.5).
SCIENCE

Prof Ahmad asked children to look
up and observe how the branches of the
tall trees look like a roof over the other
plants in the forest. He told them that
this is called a canopy (Fig. 17.7).

Activity 17.2
Visit a forest or a park in your
neighbourhood. Observe the trees and
try to identify them. You can take the
help of some elders or books on trees.
List the characteristics of the trees that
you observe, such as the height, shape
of leaves, crown, flowers, and fruits. Also
draw the crowns of some trees.
Prof Ahmad pointed out that trees
had crowns of different types and sizes.
These had created different horizontal
layers in the forest. These are known as
understoreys (Fig. 17.7). Giant and tall
trees constituted the top layer followed
by shrubs and tall grasses, and herbs
formed the lowest layer.
“Would we see similar kind of trees
in every forest?” — asked Boojho.
Prof Ahmad said, “No, due to different
climatic conditions there are variations
in the types of trees and other plants.
The types of animals also differ from
forest to forest.”

ed

Sheila wondered who would have
planted these trees. Prof Ahmad replied
that in nature trees produce enough
seeds. The forest floor provides
favourable conditions for them to
germinate and develop into seedlings

A few children were busy watching
beautiful butterflies fluttering here and
there on the flowers of shrubs and
herbs. They had a close look at the
bushes. While doing that their hair and
clothes had seeds and shrubs clinging
to them.
They came across numerous insects,
spiders, squirrels, ants and various

other small animals on the bark of the
trees, plant leaves and on decaying
leaves on the forest floor (Fig. 17.8). They
started making sketches of these
creatures. The forest floor seemed dark
coloured and was covered with a layer
of dead and decaying leaves, fruits,
seeds, twigs and small herbs. The
decaying matter was moist and warm.
Children picked up various seeds
and leaves for their collection. Walking
over the dead leaf layer on the forest floor
was like walking over a spongy carpet!
Is the decaying matter always warm?
Prof Ahmad suggested that the children
could perform an activity to get an
answer to this question.

leaves in it. Cover them with soil. Add

insects, which in turn, is taken by the
frog. The frog is consumed by snakes.
This is said to form a food chain:
Grass → insects → frog → snake → eagle.
Many food chains can be found in the
forest. All food chains are linked. If any
one food chain is disturbed, it affects
other food chains. Every part of the
forest is dependent on the other parts.
If we remove one component, say trees,
all other components would be affected.”
Prof Ahmad asked children to pick
up leaves from the forest floor and
observe them under a hand lens. They
found tiny mushrooms over the

upper layer of the soil. Does the pit feel
warm inside?
Paheli asked, “There are so many
trees here. Also, there are many forest
like this. What difference will it make if
we cut some trees for a factory?”
Prof Ahmad said, “You have read
about autotrophs, heterotrophs and
saprotrophs. You have learnt how green
plants produce food. All animals,
whether herbivores or carnivores,
depend ultimately on plants for food.
Organisms which feed on plants often
get eaten by other organisms, and so
on. For example, grass is eaten by

plants release oxygen through the
process of photosynthesis. The plants
help to provide oxygen for animal
respiration. They also maintain the
balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere (Fig. 17.10). That is
why forests are called lungs.

Paheli reminded their
friends that they have

decaying leaves. They also saw an army
of tiny insects, millipedes, ants and
beetle on them. They were wondering
how these organisms live there. Prof Ahmad
explained that apart from these animals
which are easily seen, there are several
organisms and micro-organisms that
live in the soil. Paheli wondered what
mushroom and other micro-organisms
eat. Prof Ahmad replied that they feed
upon the dead plant and animal tissues
and convert them into a dark coloured
substance called humus.
You have learnt about humus in
Chapter 9. In which layer of the soil
would you find humus? What is its
importance to the soil?
The micro-organisms which convert
the dead plants and animals to humus
are known as decomposers. These
micro-organisms play an important role
in the forest. Soon, Paheli removed some
dead leaves and discovered under them
a layer of humus on forest floor. The
presence of humus ensures that the
nutrients of the dead plants and
animals are released into the soil. From
there, these nutrients are again absorbed
by the roots of the living plants. “What
happens if an animal dies in the forest?”
Sheila asked. Tibu replied the dead
animals become food for vultures, crows,
jackals and insects.” In this way, the
nutrients are cycled. So, nothing goes
waste in a forest (Fig. 17.9).
Paheli reminded Prof Ahmad that he
had not explained why forests are called
green lungs. Prof Ahmad explained that

The children saw clouds forming in
the sky. Boojho recalled what he had
learnt about the water cycle in Class VI.
Trees take in water from their roots and
release water vapour into the air
through evaporation.
If there were fewer trees, how will the
water cycle be affected?
Tibu told them that the forest is not
just home to plants and animals. Many
people also live in the forest. Some of
them may belong to different tribes. Tibu
explained that these people depend
mostly on the forests. The forest provides

between various types of droppings.
Prof Ahmad informed them that the
forest officers could recognise the
presence of some animals in the forest
by their droppings and footprints.
Boojho called every one and showed
them a large, decaying heap of animal
dropping. Several beetles and grubs
were feeding on the heap and a bunch
of seedlings was sprouting. “These
seedlings are of the herbs and shrubs.
The animals also disperse the seeds of
certain plants and help the forest to grow

them with food, shelter, water and
medicines. They have traditional
knowledge about many medicinal plants
in the forest.
While Boojho was drinking water
from a small stream, he saw some deer
crossing the stream (Fig. 17.11). They
disappeared into the bushes. The dense
bushes and the tall grass provide
animals with the food and shelter. They
also protect them from carnivores that
live in the forest.

Paheli remembered that she

dung also provides nutrients to the
seedlings to grow”, said Prof Ahmad.
After listening to this, Boojho noted
in his notebook, “By harbouring greater
variety of plants, the forest provides
greater opportunities for food and
habitat for the herbivores. Larger
number of herbivores means increased
availability of food for a variety of
carnivores. The wide variety of animals

helps the forest to regenerate and grow.
Decomposers help in maintaining the

in the forest. Therefore, the forest is a
‘dynamic living entity’ — full of life and
vitality.”
It was about afternoon and the
children wanted to go back. T ibu
214

suggested another route for going back.
While they were going back, it started
raining. However, surprisingly, they saw
that the raindrops were not hitting the
forest floor directly. The uppermost layer
of the forest canopy intercepted the flow
of raindrops, and most of the water was
coming down through the branches and

villages and the agricultural fields of
that area were created after clearing the
forest about sixty years ago. Tibu’s
grandfather told them that when he was
young, the village was not as large as it
was now. It was also surrounded
by forests. Construction of roads,
buildings, industrial development and
increasing demand of wood created
pressure on the forests and it started
vanishing. He was not happy that the
forest adjoining their village is not
regenerating and is on the verge of
disappearing due to overgrazing of
animals and indiscriminate felling of
trees. Prof Ahmad said that if we did
things wisely we could preserve forests
and environment as well as have
development.
Children prepared a few pictures to
show the consequences of such an
event.
At the end of the visit, Prof Ahmad
asked children to sum up the
importance of forests. The children
wrote: Forests provide us with oxygen.
They protect soil and provide habitat to
a large number of animals. Forests
help in bringing good rainfall in
neighbouring areas. They are a source
of medicinal plants, timber and many
other useful products. We must preserve
our forests.

the stems of the trees. From the leaves
it was dripping slowly over branches of
the shrubs and herbs (Fig. 17.13). They
found that the ground was still dry. After
about half an hour, the rain stopped.
They noticed that the layer of dead
leaves over the forest floor appeared wet
now. But water did not stagnate in the
forest.
Boojho thought that if it had rained
so heavily in his town, it would have
flooded the drains and roads.
What would happen if it rains heavily
in your town?
Prof Ahmad told them that the forest
also acts as a natural absorber of
rainwater and allows it to seep. It helps
maintain the water table throughout the
year. Forests not only help in controlling
floods but also help maintain the flow
of water in the streams so that we get a
steady supply of water. On the other
hand, if trees are not present, rain hits
the ground directly and may flood the
area around it. Heavy rain may also
damages the soil. Roots of trees normally
bind the soil together, but in their
absence the soil is washed away or
eroded.
The children spent an hour at Tibu’s
village on their way back. The weather
of the village was quite pleasant. Villagers
told them that due to the surrounding
forest, they receive good rainfall. The air
also remained cool. Noise pollution, too
is less because the forest absorbs the
noise of the nearby highway.
The children learnt about the history
of the village. It surprised them that the

In India the area under forest cover is about 21% of the total area. It had
steadily been falling since independence. But people now seem to have
realised the importance of the forest cover. Reports suggest that the area
under forest cover has slightly increased in recent years.
