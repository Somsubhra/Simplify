n Chapter 3 you learnt that woollen
clothes are made from animal fibres.
You also know that cotton clothes
are made from plant fibres. We wear
woollen clothes during winters when it
is cold outside. Woollen clothes keep us
warm. We prefer to wear light coloured
cotton clothes when it is hot. These give
us a feeling of coolness. You might have
wondered why particular types of
clothes are suitable for a particular
season.
In winter you feel cold inside the
house. If you come out in the sun, you
feel warm. In summer, you feel hot even
inside the house. How do we know
whether an object is hot or cold? How
do we find out how hot or cold an object
is? In this chapter we shall try to seek
answers to some of these questions.

COLD

In our day-to-day life, we come across a
number of objects. Some of them are hot

We see that some objects are cold
while some are hot. You also know that
some objects are hotter than others
while some are colder than others. How
do we decide which object is hotter than
the other? We often do it by touching
the objects. But is our sense of touch
reliable? Let us find out.

A clinical thermometer consists of a
long, narrow, uniform glass tube. It has
a bulb at one end. This bulb contains
mercury. Outside the bulb, a small
shining thread of mercury can be seen.
If you do not see the mercury thread,
rotate the thermometer a bit till you see
it. You will also find a scale on the
thermometer. The scale we use is the

Is the body temperature of every
person 37°C?
The temperature of every person may
not be 37°C. It could be slightly higher
or slightly lower. Actually, what we call
normal temperature is the average body
temperature of a large number of healthy
persons.
The clinical thermometer is designed
to measure the temperature of human
body only. The temperature of human
body normally does not go below 35oC
or above 42 o C. That is the reason
that this thermometer has the range
35oC to 42oC.

Boojho got a naughty idea. He
wanted to measure the temperature
of hot milk using a clinical
thermometer. Paheli stopped him
from doing so.

convenient to use the laboratory
thermometer for this purpose.
Why does the mercury not fall or rise
in a clinical thermometer when taken
out of the mouth?
Observe a clinical thermometer
again. Do you see a kink near the bulb
(Fig. 4.6).
What is the use of the kink? It
prevents mercury level from falling on
its own.

There is a lot of concern over

You might have observed that a frying
pan becomes hot when kept on a flame.
It is because the heat passes from the
flame to the utensil. When the pan is
removed from the fire, it slowly cools

is transferred from the pan to the
surroundings. So you can understand
that in both cases, the heat flows from
a hotter object to a colder object. In fact,

substances? Let us find out.

Notice that towards the top, the air
gets heated by convection. Therefore, the
hand above the flame feels hot. On the
sides, however, there is no convection
and air does not feel as hot as at
the top.
The people living in the coastal areas
experience an interesting phenomenon.
During the day, the land gets heated
faster than the water. The air over the
land becomes hotter and rises up. The
cooler air from the sea rushes in towards
the land to take its place. The warm air
from the land moves towards the sea to
complete the cycle. The air from the sea
is called the sea breeze. To receive the
cooler sea breeze, the windows of the
houses in coastal areas are made to face
the sea. At night it is exactly the reverse
(Fig. 4.11). The water cools down more
slowly than the land. So, the cool air
from the land moves towards the sea.
This is called the land breeze. Fig. 4.11
shows this phenomenon.
When we come out in the sun, we
feel warm. How does the heat from the
sun reach us? It cannot reach us by
conduction or convection as there is no
medium such as air in most part of the

Fig. 4.9 Convection of heat in water

and water from the sides moves down.
This process continues till the whole
water gets heated. This mode of heat
transfer is known as convection.
How does the heat travel in air? In
which direction does the smoke go?
The air near the heat source gets hot
and rises. The air from the sides comes
in to take its place. In this way the air
gets heated. The following activity
confirms this idea.

distance from the flame so that they

From the sun the heat comes to us by
another process known as radiation.
The transfer of heat by radiation does
not require any medium. It can take
place whether a medium is present or
not. When we sit in front of a room
heater, we get heat by this process. A
hot utensil kept away from the flame
cools down as it transfers heat to the
surroundings by radiation. Our body
too, gives heat to the surroundings and
receives heat from it by radiation.
All hot bodies radiate heat. When
this heat falls on some object, a part of
it is reflected, a part is absorbed and a
part may be transmitted. The
temperature of the object increases due
to the absorbed part of the heat. Why

Activity 4.11

In the winter, we use woollen clothes.
Wool is a poor conductor of heat.
Moreover, there is air trapped in between
the wool fibres. This air prevents the flow
of heat from our body to the cold
surroundings. So, we feel warm.
Suppose you are given the choice in
winter of using either one thick blanket
or two thin blankets joined together.
What would you choose and why?
Remember that there would be a layer
of air in between the blankets.

What you have learnt
Our sense of touch is not always a reliable guide to the degree of hotness
of an object.



Temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness of an object.



Thermometer is a device used for measuring temperatures.



Clinical thermometer is used to measure our body temperature. The
range of this thermometer is from 35°C to 42°C. For other purposes, we
use the laboratory thermometers. The range of these thermometers is
usually from –10°C to 110°C.



The normal temperature of the human body is 37°C.



The heat flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower
temperature. There are three ways in which heat can flow from one
object to another. These are conduction, convection and radiation.

In solids, generally, the heat is transferred by conduction. In liquids
and gases the heat is transferred by convection. No medium is required
for transfer of heat by radiation.

The materials which allow heat to pass through them easily are
conductors of heat.
The materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are
called insulators.

Dark-coloured objects absorb radiation better than the light-coloured
objects. That is the reason we feel more comfortable in light-coloured
clothes in the summer.
Woollen clothes keep us warm during winter. It is so because wool is a
poor conductor of heat and it has air trapped in between the fibres.
