it absolutely still. Observe the
movements taking place in your
body. You must be blinking your
eyes, time to time. Observe the
movements in your body as you
breathe. There are so many movements
that happen in our bodies.
When you are writing in your
notebook which part of the body are you
moving? Or, when you turn and look at
your friend? Different parts of your body
move while you remain at the same
place, in these examples. You also move
from one place to another — you get up
and go to your teacher or to the school
compound, or go home after school. You
walk, run, skip, jump and move from
place to place.
Let us see how animals move from
place to place by filling up Table 8.1,
after discussing with our friends,
teachers and parents.

Walk, run, fly, jump, creep, crawl,
slither and swim – these are only a few
of the ways in which animals move from
one place to another. Why are there so
many differences in the way that
animals move from place to place? Why
is it that many animals walk while a
snake slithers or crawls and a fish
swims?

8.1 HUMAN BODY AND ITS MOVEMENTS
Let us look closely at some of our own
movements to begin with, before looking
at all these varieties of movements in
animals.
Do you enjoy doing physical exercise
at school? How do you move your hands
and legs while doing different exercises?
SCIENCE

Let us try some of the many movements,
our body is capable of.
Bowl an imaginary ball at an
imaginary wicket. How did you move
your arm? Did you rotate it at the
shoulder in a circular movement? Did
your shoulder also move? Lie down and
rotate your leg at the hip. Bend your
arm at the elbow and the leg at the knee.
Stretch your arm sideways. Bend your
arm to touch your shoulder with your
fingers. Which part of your arm did you
bend? Straighten your arm and try to
bend it downwards. Are you able to do
it?
Try to move the various parts of your
body and record their movements in
Table 8.2.

Why is it that we are able to move a
few parts of our body easily in various
directions and some only in one
direction? Why are we unable to move
some parts at all?

Activity 1
Place a scale length-wise on your arm
so that your elbow is in the centre
(Fig. 8.1).
Ask your friend to tie the scale and
your arm together. Now,
try to bend your elbow.
Are you able to do it?

Did you notice that we are able to
bend or rotate our body in places where
two parts of our body seem to be joined
together — like elbow, shoulder or neck?
These places are called joints. Can you
name more such joints? If our body has
no joints, do you think it would be
possible for us to move in any way at
all?
What exactly is joined together at
these joints?
Press your fingers against the top of
your head, face, neck, nose, ear, back of
the shoulder, hands and legs including
the fingers and toes.
Do you get a feel of something hard
pressing against your fingers? The hard
structures are the bones. Repeat this
activity on other parts of your body. So
many bones!
Bones cannot be bent. So, how do
we bend our elbow? It is not one long
bone from the upper arm to our wrist. It
is different bones joined together at the
elbow. Similarly, there are many bones
present in each part of the body. We
can bend or move our body only at those
points where bones meet.
There are different types of joints in
our body to help us carry out different
movements and activities. Let us learn
about some of them.

paper cylinder into it as in Fig. 8.2. You
can also stick the cylinder on the ball.
Put the ball in a small bowl. Is the ball
rotating freely inside the bowl? Is the
paper cylinder also rotating?
Now, imagine that the paper cylinder
is your arm and the ball is its end. The
bowl is like the part of the shoulder to
which your arm is joined. The rounded
end of one bone fits into the cavity
(hollow space) of the other bone
(Fig.8.3). Such a joint allows movements
in all directions. Can you name another
such joint you can think of, recollecting
the body movements we tried at the
beginning of this section?

our head forward and backward and
turn the head to our right or left. Try
these movements. How are these
movements different from those of our
arm that can rotate a complete circle in
its ball and socket joint? In a pivotal
joint a cylindrical bone rotates in a ring.

Hinge joints
Open and close a door a few times.
Observe the hinges of the door carefully.
They allow the door to move back
and forth.

Let us look at the kind of movement
allowed by a hinge. Make a cylinder with
cardboard or thick chart paper, as
shown in Fig. 8.4. Attach a small pencil
to the cylinder by piercing the cylinder
at the centre, as shown. Make a hollow
half cylinder from cardboard such that
the rolled up cylinder can fit inside it
easily. The hollow half cylinder with the
rolled up cylinder sitting inside it, allows
movement like a hinge. Try to move the
rolled up cylinder. How does it move?
How is this movement different from
what we saw with our constructed ball

and socket joint? We saw this kind of
movement at the elbow in Activity 1.
What we have constructed in Fig. 8.4 is
different from a hinge, of course. But, it
illustrates the direction in which a hinge
allows movement. The elbow has a hinge
joint that allows only a back and forth
movement (Fig. 8.5). Can you think of
more examples of such joints?

Fixed joints

There are some bones in our head that
are joined together at some joints. The
bones cannot move at these joints. Such
joints are called fixed joints. When you
open your mouth wide, you can move
your lower jaw away from your head,
isn’t it? Try to move your upper jaw,
now. Are you able to move it? There is a
joint between the upper jaw and the rest
of the head which is a fixed joint.
We discussed only some of the joints
that connect parts of our body.
What gives the different parts of the
body their different shapes?
If you wanted to make a doll, what
will you make first? Perhaps a
framework to give the doll shape before
making its outer structure, isn’t it? All
69

Feel the bones in your forearm,
upper arm, lower leg and upper leg. Try
to find the number of bones in each part.
Similarly, feel the bones of your ankle
and knee joints and compare these with
the X-ray images (Fig. 8.7).

Fig. 8.6 The Human skeleton

the bones in our body also form a
framework to give a shape to our body.
This framework is called the skeleton
(Fig. 8.6.)
How do we know that this is the
shape of a human skeleton? How do we
know the shapes of the different bones
in our body? We can have some idea
about the shape and number of bones
in some parts of our body by feeling
them. One way we could know this
shape better would be to look at X-ray
images of the human body.
Did you or anyone in your family
ever have an X-ray of any part of your
body taken? Sometimes when we are
hurt, or have an accident, doctors use
these X-ray images to find out about
any possible injuries that might
have happened to the bones. The Xrays show the shapes of the bones in
our bodies.

Bend your fingers. Are you able to
bend them at every joint? How many
bones does your middle finger have?
Feel the back of your palm. It seems to
have many bones, isn’t it (Fig. 8.8)? Is
your wrist flexible? It is made up of
several small bones. What will happen
if it has only one bone?

of the chest and back at the same time.
Count as many ribs (bones of the chest)
as possible. Observe Fig. 8.9 carefully
and compare with what you feel of the
chest bones. We see that the ribs are
curiously bent. They join the chest bone
and the backbone together to form a
box. This is called the rib cage. Some
important internal parts of our body lie
protected inside this cage.
Ask a friend to touch his toes without
bending his knees. Put
your fingers at the centre
of his back. Can you feel
some long and hard
structure? Starting from
the neck, move your
fingers downwards on the
back of your friend. What
you feel is his backbone.
It is made of many small
bones (Fig. 8.10). The rib
cage is joined to these
bones.

Make your friend stand with his
hands pressed to a wall. Ask him to and
try to push the wall. Do you see two bones
standing where his shoulders are? They
are called shoulder bones (Fig 8.11).
Observe Fig. 8.12 carefully. This
structure is made of pelvic bones. They
enclose the portion of your body
below the stomach. This is the part
you sit on.

Fig. 8.12 Pelvic bones.

The skull is made of many bones
joined together (Fig. 8.13). It encloses
and protects a very important part of
the body, the brain.
We discussed the many bones and
the joints of our skeleton. There are

Fig. 8.13 The skull
71

some additional parts of the skeleton
that are not as hard as the bones and
which can be bent. These are called
cartilage.
Feel your ear. Do you find any hard
bony parts that can be bent
(Fig. 8.14)? There do not seem to be any
bones here, isn’t it? Do you notice
anything different between the ear lobe
and the portions above it (Fig. 8.15), as
you press them between your fingers?

Fig. 8.15 The ear lobe

You do feel something in the upper parts
of the ear that is not as soft as the ear
lobe but, not as hard as a bone, isn’t it?
This is cartilage. Cartilage is also found
in the joints of the body.
We have seen that our skeleton is
made up of many bones, joints and
cartilage. You could see, bend and move
many of them. Draw a neat figure of the
skeleton in your notebook.
We have learnt about the bones in our
body and about joints that help us move
in different ways. What makes the bones
move the way they do? Let us find out.
Make a fist with one hand, bend your
arm at the elbow and touch your
shoulder with the thumb (Fig. 8.16). Do
you see any change in your upper arm?

o
n

72

Touch it with the other hand. Do you
feel a swollen region inside your upper
arm? This is a muscle. The muscle
bulged due to contraction (it became
smaller in length). Now bring your arm
back to its normal position. What
happened to the muscle? Is it still
contracted? You can observe similar
contraction of muscles in your leg when
you walk or run.
When contracted, the muscle
becomes shorter, stiffer and thicker. It
pulls the bone.
Muscles work in pairs. When one of
them contracts, the bone is pulled in
that direction. The other muscle of the
pair relaxes. To move the bone in the
opposite direction, the relaxed musle
contracts to pull the bone towards its
original postion, while the first relaxes.
A muscle can only pull. It cannot push.
Thus, two muscles have to work together
to move a bone (Fig. 8.16).
Are muscles and bones always
required for movement? How do other
animals move? Do all animals have
SCIENCE

bones? What about an earthworm or a
snail? Let us study the manner of
movement, that is, the gait of some
animals.

8.2 “GAIT

OF

ANIMALS”

Earthworm
Activity 5
Observe an earthworm moving on soil
in a garden. Gently lift it and place it
on a piece of blotting or filter paper.
Observe its movement (Fig. 8.17). Then
place it on a smooth glass plate or any
slippery surface. Observe its movement
now. Is it different from that on paper?
Do you find that the earthworm is able
to move easily on a hard slippery
surface?
The body of an earthworm is made
up of many rings joined end to end. An

contractions, the earthworm can move
through soil. The body secretes a slimy
substance to help the movement.
How does it fix parts of its body to
the ground? Under its body, it has a
large number of tiny bristles (hair like
structures) projecting out. The bristles
are connected with muscles. The bristles
help to get a good grip on the ground.
The earthworm, actually, eats its way
through the soil! Its body then throws
away the undigested part of the material
that it eats. This activity of an earthworm
makes the soil more useful for plants.

Fig. 8.17 Movement of earthworm

earthworm does not have bones. It has
muscles which help to extend and
shorten the body. During movement,
the earthworm first extends the front
part of the body, keeping the rear
portion fixed to the ground. Then it fixes
the front end and releases the rear end.
It then shortens the body and pulls the
rear end forward. This makes it move
forward by a small distance. Repeating
such muscle expansions and

This is called the shell and it is the
outer skeleton of the snail, but is not
made of bones. The shell is a single unit
and does not help in moving from place
to place. It has to be dragged along.
Place the snail on a glass plate and
watch it. When it starts moving,
carefully lift the glass plate along with
the snail over your head. Observe its
movements from beneath.
A thick structure and the head of the
snail may come out of an opening in
73

the shell. The thick structure is its foot,
made of strong muscles. Now, carefully
tilt the glass plate. The wavy motion of
the foot can be seen. Is the movement of
a snail slow or fast as compared to an
earthworm?

Observe a cockroach (Fig. 8.19).
Cockroaches walk and climb as well
as fly in the air. They have three pairs

This outer skeleton is made of different

as wings. The shoulder bones are strong.
The breastbones are modified to hold
muscles of flight which are used to move

There are two pairs of wings attached

muscles move the wings when the
cockroach flies.

Birds

Birds fly in the air and walk on the
ground. Some birds like ducks and
swans also swim in water. The birds can
fly because their bodies are well suited
for flying. Their bones are hallow and
light. The bones of the hind limbs are
typical for walking and perching. The

you able to make the boat move in water
when you push it from this side?

SCIENCE

Fish also have other fins on their
body which mainly help to keep the
balance of the body and to keep
direction, while swimming. Did you ever
notice that under water divers wear fin
like flippers on their feet, to help them
move easily in water?
Fig. 8.22 Fish

Have you noticed that the shape of a
boat is somewhat like a fish (Fig 8.22)?
The head and tail of the fish are smaller
than the middle portion of the body –
the body tapers at both ends. This body
shape is called streamlined.
The shape is such that water can flow
around it easily and allow the fish to
move in water.The skeleton of the fish
is covered with strong muscles. During
swimming, muscles make the front part
of the body curve to one side and the
tail part swings towards the opposite
side. The fish forms a curve as shown
in Fig. 8.23. Then, quickly, the body and
tail curve to the other side. This makes
a jerk and pushes the body forward. A
series of such jerks make the fish swim
ahead. This is helped by the fins of
the tail.

Have you seen a snake slither? Does it
move straight(Fig. 8.24)?
Snakes have a long backbone. They
have many thin muscles. They are
connected to each other even though they
are far from one another. They also
interconnect the backbone, ribs and skin.
The snake’s body curves into many
loops. Each loop of the snake gives it a
forward push by pressing against the
ground. Since its long body makes
many loops and each loop gives it this
push, the snake moves forward very fast
and not in a straightline.
We have learned about the use of
bones and muscles for the movements
of different animals. Paheli and Boojho
have many questions in their sacks
about the different movements in
animals. So must you be having many
unanswered questions buzzing in your

Fig. 8.24 Movement in a snake
75

minds? The ancient Greek philosopher
Aristotle, in his book Gait of Animals,
asked himself these questions. Why do
different animals have the body parts
that they do have and how do these
body parts help animals to move the
way they do? What are the similarities
and differences in these body parts
between different animals? How many
body parts are needed by different
animals for moving from place to

place? Why two legs for humans and
four for cows and buffaloes? Many
animals seem to be having an even
number of legs, why? Why is the
bending of our legs different from that
of our arms?
So many questions and perhaps
we have looked for some answers
through our activities in this chapter
and we need to look for many
more answers.



Bones and cartilage form the skeleton of the human body. It gives the
frame and shape to the body and helps in movement. It protects the
inner organs.



The skeleton comprises the skull, the back bone, ribs and the breast
bone, shoulder and hipbones, and the bones of hands and legs.



The bones are moved by alternate contractions and relaxations of two
sets of muscles.



The bone joints are of various kinds depending on the nature of joints
and direction of movement they allow.



Strong muscles and light bones work together to help the birds fly. They
fly by flapping their wings.



Fish swim by forming loops alternately on two sides of the body.



Snakes slither on the ground by looping sideways. A large number of
bones and associated muscles push the body forward.



The body and legs of cockroaches have hard coverings forming an outer
skeleton. The muscles of the breast connected with three pairs of legs
and two pairs of wings help the cockroach to walk and fly.



Earthworms move by alternate extension and contraction of the body
using muscles. Tiny bristles on the underside of the body help in gripping
the ground.



Snails move with the help of a muscular foot.

THINGS TO THINK ABOUT

We discussed the many movements our bodies are capable of. Healthy bones,
muscles, joints and cartilages are needed by the body for all these movements.
Some of us suffer from conditions that could make these movements not so easy. In
a whole class activity, try to find ways that one would manage everyday activities, if
any one of our body movements was not possible. In Activity 1, for instance, you
tied a scale on your arm and disabled the elbow movement. Think of other ways of
restricting normal body movements and find ways that everyday activities could
then be managed.
