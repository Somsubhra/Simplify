5.1 ACIDS

AND

BASES

Curd, lemon juice, orange juice and
vinegar taste sour. These substances
taste sour because they contain acids.
The chemical natur e of such
substances is acidic. The word acid
comes from the Latin word acere which
means sour. The acids in these
substances are natural acids.
What about baking soda? Does it also
taste sour? If not, what is its taste? Since,
it does not taste sour it means, that it
has no acids in it. It is bitter in taste. If
you rub its solution between fingers, it
feels soapy. Substances like these which
are bitter in taste and feel soapy on
touching are known as bases. The nature
of such substances is said to be basic.
If we cannot taste every substance,
how do we find its nature?
Special type of substances are used
to test whether a substance is acidic or
basic. These substances are known as
indicators. The indicators change their
colour when added to a solution
containing an acidic or a basic
substance. Turmeric, litmus, china rose
petals (Gudhal), etc., are some of the
naturally occurring indicators.

The most commonly used natural
indicator is litmus. It is extracted
from lichens (Fig. 5.1). It has a
mauve (purple) colour in distilled
water. When added to an acidic
solution, it turns red and when
added to a basic solution, it turns
blue. It is available in the form of a
solution, or in the form of strips of
paper, known as litmus paper.
Generally, it is available as red and
blue litmus paper (Fig. 5.1).

Are you familiar with the term acid rain? Have you ever heard about damaging
effect of acid rain? As the name indicates the rain containing excess of acids is
called an acid rain. Where do these acids come from? The rain becomes acidic
because carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (which are released
into the air as pollutants) dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid, sulphuric
acid and nitric acid respectively. Acid rain can cause damage to buildings,
historical monuments, plants and animals.

Great care should be taken while
handling laboratory acids and bases
because these are corrosive in nature,
irritating and harmful to skin.

Stir the tube gently. Is there any change
in the colour of the solution? Continue
adding the sodium hydroxide solution
drop by drop while stirring till the pink
colour just appears.
Now add one more drop of dilute
hydrochloric acid. What do you observe?
The solution again becomes colourless.
Again add one drop of sodium
hydroxide solution. Is there any change
in colour? The solution again becomes
pink in colour.
It is evident that when the solution
is basic, phenolphthalein gives a pink
colour. On the other hand, when the
solution is acidic, it remains colourless.

CAUTION

indicators on each of these solutions.

5.3 NEUTRALISATION

We have learnt that acids turn blue
litmus red and bases turn red litmus
blue. Let us see what happens when an
acid is mixed with a base.
We are going to use an indicator you
have not used so far. It is called
phenolphthalein.

Note down the colour of phenolphthalein
solution also. Add 2–3 drops of the
indicator to the acid. Now shake the test
tube gently. Do you observe any change
in colour of the acid?

sodium hydroxide solution by a dropper.

have learnt in Chapter 2. But too
much of acid in the stomach causes
indigestion. Sometimes indigestion
is painful. To relieve indigestion, we
take an antacid such as milk of
magnesia, which contains magnesium
hydroxide. It neutralises the effect of
excessive acid.

When an ant bites, it injects
the acidic liquid (formic acid) into the
skin. The effect of the acid can be
neutralised by rubbing moist baking
soda (sodium hydrogen carbonate) or
calamine solution, which contains zinc
carbonate.

When an acidic solution is mixed
with a basic solution, both the solutions
neutralise the effect of each other. When
an acid solution and a base solution are
mixed in suitable amounts, both the
acidic nature of the acid and the basic
nature of the base are destroyed. The
resulting solution is neither acidic nor
basic. Touch the test tube immediately
after neutralisation. What do you
observe? In neutralisation reaction, heat
is always produced, or evolved. The
evolved heat raises the temperature of
the reaction mixture.
In neutralisation reaction a new
substance is formed. This is called salt.
Salt may be acidic, basic or neutral in
nature. Thus, neutralisation can be
defined as follows:
The reaction between an acid and
→ Salt+Water
a base is known as neutralisation. Salt
and water are produced in this process
with the evolution of heat.
Acid+Base → Salt+Water

(Heat is evolved)
The following reaction is an example:
Hydrochloric acid (HCl) + Sodium
hydroxide (NaOH)
Sodium chloride (NaCl) + Water (H2O)

Soil treatment

Excessive use of chemical fertilisers
makes the soil acidic. Plants do not
grow well when the soil is either too
acidic or too basic. When the soil is
too acidic, it is treated with bases like
quick lime (calcium oxide) or slaked
lime (calcium hydroxide). If the soil
is basic, organic matter is added to
it. Organic matter releases acids
which neutralises the basic nature of
the soil.

Factory wastes

The wastes of many factories
contain acids. If they are allowed to
flow into the water bodies, the acids
will kill fish and other organisms.
The factory wastes are, therefore,
neutralised
by
adding
basic
substances.
