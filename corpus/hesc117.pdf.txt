P

aheli and Boojho visited their
grandparents’ village during
summer break. After dinner, they
went on to the roof of the house. It was a
clear cloudless night. They were
surprised to see a large number of bright
stars in the sky. They had never seen such
a beautiful scene in their city (Fig. 17.1).

SOLAR SYSTEM
at a place where there are no bright lights
and the atmosphere is clear.
Look at the sky on a dark, clear night.
You see the entire sky dotted with
countless stars, some bright and some
not so bright. Observe them carefully.
Do all of them appear to twinkle? Do
you find any star-like object which does

Fig. 17.1: Night sky

Paheli wondered, why the village sky
was so different from the night sky in
big cities? Her grandfather explained that
due to bright light, smoke and dust, sky
in big cities is rarely clear. Night sky
watching can be a fascinating experience

not twinkle? The objects which do not
twinkle are planets.
The moon is the brightest object in
the night sky. The stars, the planets,
the moon and many other objects in the
sky are called celestial objects.

Are all celestial objects similar? Let
us find out.

17.1 The Moon
Activity 17.1
Observe the moon continuously for
several nights, preferably from one
full moon to the next. Make a sketch
of the moon every night in your note
book and note from the day of the
full moon. Also note everyday the
part of the sky (east or west) in
which the moon is seen.
Is there a change in the shape of the
moon everyday? Are there days when
the shape of the moon appears to be
perfectly round? Are there days when
the moon cannot be seen at all even if
the sky is clear?
The day on which the whole disc of
the moon is visible is known as the full
moon day. Thereafter, every night the

size of the bright part of the moon
appears to become thinner and thinner.
On the fifteenth day the moon is not
visible. This day is known as the new
moon day. The next day, only a small
portion of the moon appears in the sky.
This is known as the crescent moon.
Then again the moon grows larger every
day. On the fifteenth day once again we
get a full view of the moon.
The various shapes of the bright part
of the moon as seen during a month
are called phases of the moon (Fig. 17.2).
The time period between one full moon
to the next full moon is slightly longer
than 29 days. In many calendars this
period is called a month.

Why does the moon change
its shape every day?

Fig.17.2 : Phases of the moon
218

SCIENCE

Let us try to understand why phases
of the moon occur. You have studied in
Chapter 16 that the moon does not
produce its own light, whereas the Sun
and other stars do. We see the moon
because the sunlight falling on it gets
reflected towards us (Fig. 17.3). We,
therefore, see only that part of the moon,
from which the light of the Sun is
reflected towards us.

Activity 17.2
Take a big ball or a pitcher. Paint
half of it white and half black in
colour.
Go out into the playground with
two of your friends. Draw a circle of
radius about 2 m on the ground.
Divide the circle into eight equal
parts as shown in Fig. 17.4.
Stand at the centre of the circle.
Ask a friend to hold the ball at
different points of the circle. Ask her
to keep the white portion of the ball
always towards the Sun. If you are
performing this activity in the
morning then the white portion of
the ball should be kept towards the

Fig. 17.3 : Moon is visible due to reflected
sunlight

east. If the activity is being
performed in the afternoon then the
white portion of the ball should be
kept towards the west. In each case
the line dividing the white and
black portions is kept vertical.
Standing at the centre of the
circle observe the visible white
portion of the ball while your friend
stands at the points on the circle
marked earlier. Draw the shape of
the white portion as you see it.
Compare your drawings with the
different phases of the moon as
shown in Fig. 17.5.

these positions in your notebook. In
which part of the sky would you look
for the full moon?
The size of the illuminated part of
the moon visible from the Earth
increases each day after the new moon
day. After the full moon day, the sunlit
part of the moon visible from the Earth
decreases in size every day.

I have heard that we
never see the back side of
the moon from the Earth.
Is it true?

Can you now guess the relative
positions of the Sun, moon and the
Earth on the day of the full moon and
on the day of the new moon? Sketch

Activity 17.3
Draw a circle of about 1m diameter
on the ground. Ask one of your
friends to stand at the centre of this
circle. You revolve around your
SCIENCE

friend in such a manner that your
face always remains towards him.
Can your friend see your back? How
many rotations did you complete in
one revolution? The moon revolves
around the Earth in a similar
manner.
The moon completes one rotation on
its axis as it completes one revolution
around the Earth.
The Moon’s Surface
The moon is a fascinating object for
poets and story-tellers. But when
astronauts landed on the moon, they
found that the moon’s surface is dusty
and barren. There are many craters of
different sizes. It also has a large number
of steep and high mountains (Fig. 17.7).
Some of these are as high as the highest
mountains on the Earth.

Can we hear any sound
on the moon?

We learnt in Chapter 13
that sound cannot
travel when there is no
medium. Then, how can
we hear any sound on
the moon?
Did You Know?
On July 21, 1969 (Indian time) the
American astronaut Neil Armstrong
landed on the moon for the first time
followed by Edwin Aldrin.

moon?
STARS AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM

17.2 The Stars
What other objects do you see in the
night sky? There is a large number of
stars in the sky. Observe carefully on a
dark night and from a place away from
a big city. Are all the stars equally
221

bright? Are they of the same colour? In
fact, stars emit light of their own. The
Sun is also a star. Why does it appear
so large compared to the other stars?
Which appears bigger, a football
placed near you, or a football placed at
a distance of 100 m? The stars are
millions of times farther away than the
Sun. Therefore, the stars appear to us
like points.
The Sun is nearly 150,000,000
kilometres (150 million km) away from
the Earth.
The next nearest star is Alpha
Centauri. It is at a distance of about
40,000,000,000,000 km from the
Earth. Can you read this distance in
kilometres conveniently? Some stars
are even further away.
Such
large
distances
are
expressed in another unit known as
light year. It is the distance travelled
by light in one year. Remember that
the speed of light is about 300,000
km per second. Thus, the distance of
the Sun from the Earth may be said
to be about 8 light minutes. The
distance of Alpha Centauri is about
4.3 light years.

If light from stars takes
years to reach us, I
wonder if we are looking
into the past when we
look at stars.

I want to know why we do
not see the stars during
the day. Why are they
visible only at night?
222

In fact, the stars are present in the
sky during the day-time also. However,
they are not visible then because of the
bright sunlight.
Observe some prominent star or a
group of stars in the sky for about two
hours or more. What do you find? Do
you find any change in the positions of
stars in the sky?
You will find that the stars appear
to move from east to west. A star which
rises in the east in the evening, sets in
the west in the early morning.
Why do stars appear to move from
east to west? Let us find out.

Activity 17.4
Stand in the centre of a big room
and start rotating. In which
direction will the objects in the room
appear to move? Do you see them
moving in the direction opposite to
your motion?
Paheli recalls that when she is in a
moving train the nearby trees and
buildings appear to move in the
backward direction.
If the stars appear to move from east
to west, could it mean that the Earth,
rotates from west to east?

Now I understand
why the Sun appears
to rise in the east and
set in the west as the
Earth rotates from
west to east on
its axis.
SCIENCE

My grandfather told me that
there is one star in the sky
which does not move at all.
How is it possible?

There is actually a star, the pole star,
which is situated in the direction of the
earth’s axis. It does not appear to move
(Fig. 17.10).

Activity 17.5
Take an umbrella and open it. Make
about 10-15 stars out of white
paper. Paste one star at the position
of the central rod of the umbrella
and others at different places on the
cloth near the end of each spoke
(Fig. 17.9).

Fig 17.10: The Pole star lies close to the axis of
rotation of the Earth

17.3 Constellations
Look at the sky for some time. Can you
see some stars forming groups with
shapes like those in Fig. 17.11.
The stars forming a group that has a
recognisable shape is called a
constellation.

Fig. 17.9 : Pole star does not appear to move

Now rotate the umbrella by holding
its central rod in your hand. Observe
the stars on the umbrella. Is there
any star which does not appear to
move? Where is this star located?
If there were a star located where the
axis of rotation of the Earth meets
the sky, could this star also be
stationary?

STARS AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Constellations were devised by
ancient people to be able to recognise
stars in the sky. The shapes of
constellations resemble objects
familiar to those people.

You can easily identify some
constellations in the night sky. For this,
you should know how a particular
constellation looks like and where to
look for it in the night sky.
One
of
the
most
famous
constellations which you can see during

summer time in the early part of the
night is Ursa Major [Fig.17.11 (a)].
It is also known as the Big Dipper,
the Great Bear or the Saptarshi.
There are seven prominent stars in
this constellation. It appears like a big
ladle or a question mark. There are three
stars in the handle of the ladle and four
in its bowl (Fig. 17.12).

(d) Leo Major

Activity 17.6
Observe this constellation for a few
hours. Do you find any change in
its shape? Do you find any change
in its position?
You will observe that the shape
of the constellation remains the
same.
You will also find that the
constellation appears to move in the
sky from east to west.

I have heard that we
can locate the Pole
Star with the help of
Ursa Major.

Activity 17.7

Fig. 17.12: Dipper used for drinking water in
ancient times.
224

This activity should be performed
on a clear moonless night during
summer at about 9.00 pm. Look
towards the northern part of the sky
and identify Ursa Major. You may
get help from elders in your family.
SCIENCE

Look at the two stars at the end of
Ursa Major. Imagine a straight line
passing through these stars as
shown in Fig. 17.13. Extend this
imaginary line towards the north
direction. (About five times the
distance between the two stars).
This line will lead to a star which is
not too bright. This is the Pole Star.
Observe the Pole star for some time.
Note that it does not move at all as
other stars drift from east to west.

Pole
Star?
Compare
your
observations with those in Fig.
17.14.

Pole star

Fig. 17.14: Ursa Major moves around the Pole
Star.

In fact, all the stars appear to revolve
around the Pole Star.
Note that the Pole Star is not visible
from the southern hemisphere. Some
of the northern constellations like
Ursa Major may also not be visible
from some points in the southern
hemisphere.
Fig. 17.13: Locating the pole star

Activity 17.8
During a summer night, observe
Ursa Major 3-4 times at an interval
of 2 to 3 hours. Also locate the Pole
Star each time. Does Ursa Major
appear to move from east to west?
Does it appear to revolve around the
STARS AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Orion is another well-known
constellation that can be seen during
winter in the late evenings. It is one of
the most magnificent constellations in
the sky. It also has seven or eight bright
stars [Fig. 17.11(b)] Orion is also called
the Hunter. The three middle stars
represent the belt of the hunter. The
four bright stars appear to be arranged
in the form of a quadrilateral.
225

The star Sirius, which is the
brightest star in the sky, is located
close to Orion. To locate Sirius, imagine
a straight line passing through the
three middle stars of Orion. Look along
this line towards the east. This line will
lead you to a very bright star. It is
Sirius. (Fig. 17.15).

Fig. 17.15: Locating - Sirius

Cassiopeia is another prominent
constellation in the northern sky. It is
visible during winter in the early part
of the night. It looks like a distorted
letter W or M [Fig. 17.11(c)].
Did You Know?
A constellation does not have
only 5-10 stars. It has a large
number of stars (Fig. 17.16).
However, we can see only the bright
stars in a constellation with our
naked eye.
All the stars which make up a
constellation are not at the same
distance. They are just in the same
line of sight in the sky.
226

Fig. 17.16

17.4 The Solar System
The Sun and the celestial bodies which
revolve around it form the solar system.
It consists of large number of bodies
such as planets, comets, asteroids and
meteors. The gravitational attraction
between the Sun and these objects
keeps them revolving around it.
The Earth, as you know, also
revolves around the Sun. It is a member
of the solar system. It is a planet. There
are seven other planets that revolve
around the Sun. The eight planets in
their order of distance from the Sun
are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars ,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
SCIENCE

Fig. 17.17 : The solar system (not to scale)

Figure 17.17 shows a schematic view
of the solar system.
I had read that there are nine
planets in the solar system
Did you know?
Till 2006 there were nine planets in
the solar system. Pluto was the
farthest planet from the Sun.
In 2006, the International
Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted a
new definition of a planet. Pluto does
not fit this definition. It is no longer
a planet of the solar system.

Let us know about some members of
the solar family.
The Sun
The Sun is the nearest star from us. It
is continuously emitting huge amounts
STARS AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM

of heat and light. The Sun is the source
of almost all energy on the Earth. In
fact, the Sun is the main source of heat
and light for all the planets.
The Planets
The planets look like stars, but they do
not have light of their own. They merely
reflect the sunlight that falls on them.
Can you distinguish between planets
and stars?
The simplest method of identifying
planets from stars is that stars twinkle,
whereas planets do not. Also the planets
keep changing their positions with
respect to the stars.
A planet has a definite path in which
it revolves around the Sun. This path is
called an orbit. The time taken by a
planet to complete one revolution is
called its period of revolution. The period
227

of revolution increases as the distance
of the planet increases from the sun.

Besides revolving around the Sun, a
planet also rotates on its own axis like a
top (Fig. 17.19). The time taken by a
planet to complete one rotation is called
its period of rotation.

I wonder why the planets do
not collide while revolving
around the Sun.

Activity 17.9
Go out into the playground with four
or five of your friends. Draw four
circles of radii 1m, 1.8m, 2.5m and
3.8m, all having a common centre
(Fig. 17.18).
Ask one of your friends to stand
in the centre and represent the Sun.
Your other four friends may
represent Mercury, Venus, Earth
and Mars.
Ask your friends to move around
the Sun in anti-clockwise direction
in their own orbits (Fig. 17.18). Do
they collide with one another?

Fig. 17.19 : A Planet rotates on its own axis
like a top

Some planets are known to have
moons/satellites revolving round them.
Any celestial body revolving around
another celestial body is called its
satellite.
The Earth revolves
around the Sun. Does it
make Earth a satellite
of the Sun?

Fig. 17.18 : Planets move in their own orbits
228

SCIENCE

The Earth can be said to be a satellite
of the Sun, though generally we call it a
planet of the Sun. We use the term
satellite for the bodies revolving around
planets. Moon is a satellite of the Earth.
There are many man-made satellites
revolving round the Earth. These are
called artificial satellites.

Mercury (Budh)
The planet mercury is nearest to the
Sun. It is the smallest planet of our solar
system. Because Mercury is very close
to the Sun, it is very difficult to observe
it, as most of the time it is hidden in the
glare of the Sun. However, it can be
observed just before sunrise or just after
sunset, near the horizon. So it is visible
only at places where trees or buildings
do not obstruct the view of the horizon.
Mercury has no satellite of its own.

Activity 17.10
Find out from some newspaper or
from an almanac the time when
Venus is visible in the sky. You can
easily recognise Venus by its
brightness. Remember that Venus
cannot be seen very high in the sky.
You must try to observe Venus
either 1-3 hours before sunrise or
1-3 hours after sunset.
Venus has no moon or satellite of its
own. Rotation of Venus on its axis is
somewhat unusual. It rotates from east
to west while the Earth rotates from west
to east.

Does it mean that on Venus,
the Sun would rise in the
west and set in the east?

If you get a chance, try to observe
Venus through a telescope. You will
observe that Venus shows phases just
like the moon (Fig. 17.20).

Venus (Shukra)
Venus is earth’s nearest planetary
neighbour. It is the brightest planet in
the night sky.
Sometimes Venus appears in the
eastern sky before sunrise. Some times
it appears in the western sky just after
sunset. Therefore it is often called a
morning or an evening star, although it
is not a star. Try to locate Venus in the
night sky.
STARS AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Fig. 17.20 : Phases of Venus

The Earth
The Earth is the only planet in the solar
system on which life is known to exist.
Some special environmental conditions
229

are responsible for the existence and
continuation of life on the Earth. These
include just the right distance from the
Sun, so that it has the right temperature
range, the presence of water and suitable
atmosphere and a blanket of ozone.

We must take special care to
protect our environment so that
life on Earth is not disturbed.

You are familiar with the equator of
the Earth. The plane of the equator
is called the equatorial plane (Fig.
17.21). The plane in which the Earth
revolves round the Sun is called the
orbital plane of the Earth (Fig. 17.21).
These two planes are inclined to each
other at an angle of 23.5º. This
means that the axis of the Earth is
inclined to its orbital plane at an
angle of 66.5º.

From space, the Earth appears bluegreen due to the reflection of light from
water and landmass on its surface.
The axis of rotation of the Earth is
not perpendicular to the plane of its
orbit. The tilt is responsible for the
change of seasons on the Earth. The
Earth has only one moon.

If I am 13 years old, how many
times have I gone round the sun?

Mars (Mangal)
The next planet, the first outside the
orbit of the Earth is Mars. It appears
slightly reddish and, therefore, it is also
called the red planet. Mars has two small
natural satellites.

Jupiter (Brihaspati)
Jupiter is the largest planet of the solar
system. It is so large that about 1300
earths can be placed inside this giant
230

Fig. 17.21 : Earth rotates on a tilted axis

planet. However, the mass of Jupiter is
about 318 times that of our Earth. It
rotates very rapidly on its axis.

I have an idea! If you take a
large ball which can
accommodate about 1300
peas, then the ball will
represent Jupiter and one
pea will represent the Earth.
SCIENCE

Fig. 17.22 : Jupiter and its four large satellites.

Jupiter has a large number of
satellites. It also has faint rings around
it. You can easily recognise Jupiter as it
appears quite bright in the sky. If you
observe it with the help of a telescope,
you can also see four of its large moons
(Fig. 17.22).

Saturn (Shani)
Beyond Jupiter is Saturn which appears
yellowish in colour. What makes it
unique in the solar system is its beautiful

Boojho has a

rings. These rings are not visible with
the naked eye. You can observe them with
a small telescope. Saturn also has a large
number of satellites.
One interesting thing about Saturn
is that it is the least dense among all
the planets. Its density is less than that
of water.
Uranus and Neptune
These are the outermost planets of the
solar system. They can be seen only with
the help of large telescopes. Like Venus,
Uranus also rotates from east to west.
The most remarkable feature of Uranus
is that it has highly tilted rotational axis
(Fig. 17.24). As a result, in its orbital
motion it appears to roll on its side.
The first four planets, Mercury,
Venus, Earth and Mars are much nearer

Fig. 17.24 : Uranus in its orbital path

the Sun than the other four planets.
They are called the inner planets. The
inner planets have very few moons.
The planets outside the orbit of Mars,
namely Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune are much farther off than the
inner planets. They are called the outer
planets. They have a ring system around
them. The outer planets have large
number of moons.

17.5 Some Other Members of
the Solar System
There are some other bodies which
revolve around the Sun. They are also
members of the solar system. Let us
learn about some of them.
Asteroids
There is a large gap in between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter (Fig. 17.25). This
gap is occupied by a large number of
small objects that revolve around the
Sun. These are called asteroids.
Asteroids can only be seen through large
telescopes.

Asteroids

SCIENCE

Comets
Comets are also members of our solar
system. They revolve around the Sun
in highly elliptical orbits. However, their
period of revolution round the Sun is
usually very long. A Comet appears
generally as a bright head with a long
tail. The length of the tail grows in size
as it approaches the sun. The tail of a
comet is always directed away from the
sun (Fig. 17.26).

see bright streaks of light in the sky (Fig.
17.27). These are commonly known as
shooting stars, although they are not
stars. They are called meteors. A meteor
is usually a small object that
occasionally enters the earth’s
atmosphere. At that time it has a very
high speed. The friction due to the
atmosphere heats it up. It glows and
evaporates quickly. That is why the
bright steak lasts for a very short time.

Fig. 17.26 : Different position of a Comet

Many comets are known to appear
periodically. One such comet is Halley’s
comet, which appears after nearly every
76 years. It was last seen in 1986. Can
you tell, when Halley’s comet will be
visible again?
Superstitions about the Comets
Some people think that comets are
messengers of disasters, such as
wars, epidemics and floods. But these
are all myths and superstitions.
Appearance of a comet is a natural
phenomenon. We have no reason to
be afraid of it.

Meteors and Meteorites
At night, when the sky is clear and the
moon is not there, you may sometimes

Some meteors are large so that they
can reach the Earth before they
evaporate completely. The body that
reaches the Earth is called a meteorite.
Meteorites
help
scientists
in
investigating the nature of the material
from which the solar system was formed.
Meteor Showers
When the Earth crosses the tail of a
comet, swarms of meteors are seen.
These are known as meteor showers.
Some meteor showers occur at
regular intervals each year. You can
find the time of their appearance from
a scientific magazine or from the
internet.
233

Artificial Satellites
You must have heard that there are a
number of artificial satellites which are
orbiting the Earth. You might wonder
how artificial satellites are different from
the natural satellites. The artificial
satellites are man-made. They are
launched from the Earth. They revolve
around the Earth much closer than
earth’s natural satellite, the moon.
India has built and launched several
artificial satellites. Aryabhatta was the
first Indian satellite. Some other Indian

satellites are INSAT, IRS, Kalpana-1,
EDUSAT, etc. (Fig. 17.28).
Artificial satellites have many
practical applications. They are used for
forecasting weather, transmitting
television and radio signals. They are
also used for telecommunication and
remote sensing.
I want to tell you that by remote
sensing we mean collecting
information from a distance.

Extended Learning — Activities and Projects
1.

If possible, visit a planetarium. There are planetariums in many
cities. In a planetarium you can see the motion of the stars,
constellations and planets on a large dome.

2.

On a moonless night observe the sky for a few hours. Look out for a
meteor, which appears as a streak of light. September-November is
a good time for observing meteors.

3.

Learn to identify the planets visible to the naked eye and some
prominent constellations such as Great Bear (Saptarshi) and Orion.
Also try to locate the Pole Star and the star Sirius.

4.

Select a convenient place on the roof of your house or in some
playground from where you can watch sunrise clearly. Remember
that you will have to do this activity for a few months. So, choose
the place carefully. On a sheet of chart paper draw the outline of
the eastern horizon indicating big trees, poles, etc. Mark the outline
of the sheet so that you can place it in the same position every
time. After every two weeks, note the position from where the Sun
rises and mark this on your chart paper (Fig. 17.30). Also note the
date of your observation. Repeat this for a few months.
It is advisable that you start observations in the month of November
or May.

Fig. 17.30 : Position of sunrise on different dates
Does the Sun always rise from the same direction? Discuss your
observations with you teacher, parents and elderly people in your
family or in the neighbourhood.

Did You Know ?
Only on two days in a year, March 21 and September 23, the Sun rises
exactly in the east. On all other days, the Sun rises either north of east
or south of east.
From summer solstice (around June 21) the point of sunrise gradually
shift towards the south. The Sun is then said to be in dakshinayan (moving
south). It keeps moving towards south till winter solstice (around
December 22). Thereafter, the point of sunrise changes direction and
starts moving towards north. The Sun is then said to be in uttarayan
(moving north).

Form a group of students. Prepare a model of the solar system
showing the planets, and their relative sizes. For this take a large
chart paper. Make spheres representing different planets according
to their relative size (Use Table 17.1). You may use newspaper, clay
or plasticine to make spheres. You can cover these spheres with
paper of different colours. Exhibit your models in the class.

STARS AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM

239

Did you know ?
In ancient times, it was believed that the Earth was at the centre
of the universe and the moon, the planets, the Sun and stars
were orbiting around it. About 500 years ago, a Polish priest
and astronomer, named Nicolaus Copernicus (1473 – 1543),
stated that the Sun was at the centre of the solar system and
the planets revolved around it. It was a revolutionary idea. Even
Copernicus hesitated to publish his work. His work was
published in the year of his death in 1543.
In 1609, Galileo designed his own telescope. Through this
telescope Galileo observed moons of Jupiter, phases of Venus
and rings of Saturn. He argued that all the planets must orbit
the Sun and not the Earth.
Thus you can see that ideas and concepts grow and change.
How about your own ideas? Do you keep your mind open to
accept new ideas when there is good evidence to support it?
