OR

FAST

We know that some vehicles move faster
than others. Even the same vehicle may
move faster or slower at different times.
Make a list of ten objects moving along
a straight path. Group the motion of
these objects as slow and fast. How did
you decide which object is moving slow
and which one is moving fast?
If vehicles are moving on a road in
the same direction, we can easily tell
which one of them is moving faster than
the other.

n Class VI, you learnt about different
types of motions. You learnt that a
motion could be along a straight line,
it could be circular or periodic. Can you
recall these three types of motions?
Table 13.1 gives some common
examples of motions. Identify the type
of motion in each case.

Activity 13.1

Look at Fig. 13.1. It shows the position
of some vehicles moving on a road in
the same direction at some instant of
time. Now look at Fig. 13.2. It shows the
position of the same vehicles after some
time. From your observation of the two
figures, answer the following questions:
Which vehicle is moving the fastest
of all? Which one of them is moving the
slowest of all?
The distance moved by objects in a
given interval of time can help us to
decide which one is faster or slower. For
example, imagine that you have gone to
see off your friend at the bus stand.
Suppose you start pedalling your bicycle
at the same time as the bus begins to
move. The distance covered by you after

is the highest. One who takes

distance of 100 metres has the
highest speed.

You are probably familiar with
the word speed. In the
examples given above, a higher
speed seems to indicate that a
given distance has been
covered in a shorter time, or a
larger distance covered in a
given time.
The most convenient way to
find out which of the two or
more objects is moving faster
is to compare the distances
moved by them in a unit time.
Thus, if we know the distance
covered by two buses in one
hour, we can tell which one is
slower. We call the distance
covered by an object in a unit
time as the speed of the object.
When we say that a car is
moving with a speed of 50
kilometres per hour, it implies
that it will cover a distance of
50 kilometres in one hour. However, a
car seldom moves with a constant speed
for one hour. In fact, it starts moving
slowly and then picks up speed. So,
when we say that the car has a speed of
50 kilometres per hour, we usually
consider only the total distance covered
by it in one hour. We do not bother
whether the car has been moving with

In everyday life we seldom find objects
moving with a constant speed over long
distances or for long durations of time.
If the speed of an object moving along
a straight line keeps changing, its
motion is said to be non-uniform. On
the other hand, an object moving along
a straight line with a constant speed
is said to be in uniform motion. In
this case, the average speed is the
same as the actual speed.

they found that the sun rises everyday
in the morning. The time between one
sunrise and the next was called a day.
Similarly, a month was measured from
one new moon to the next. A year was
fixed as the time taken by the earth to
complete one revolution of the sun.
Often we need to measure intervals
of time which are much shorter than a
day. Clocks or watches are perhaps the
most common time measuring devices.
Have you ever wondered how clocks and
watches measure time?
The working of clocks is rather
complex. But all of them make use of
some periodic motion. One of the most
well-known periodic motions is that of

a constant speed or not during that
hour. The speed calculated here is
actually the average speed of the car. In
this book we shall use the term speed
for average speed. So, for us the speed
is the total distance covered divided
by the total time taken. Thus,

We can determine the speed of a given
object once we can measure the time
taken by it to cover a certain distance.
In Class VI you learnt how to measure
distances. But, how do we measure
time? Let us find out.

clocks is much more accurate than that

Units of time and speed

ed

The basic unit of time is a second. Its
symbol is s. Larger units of time are
minutes (min) and hours (h). You
already know how these units are related
to one another.
What would be the basic unit of
speed?
Since the speed is distance/time, the
basic unit of speed is m/s. Of course, it
could also be expressed in other units
such as m/min or km/h.
You must remember that the
symbols of all units are written in
singular. For example, we write 50 km
and not 50 kms, or 8 cm and not 8 cms.

shown is just a sample. Your
observations could be different from
this. Repeat this activity a few times and
record your observations. By dividing
the time taken for 20 oscillations by 20,
get the time taken for one oscillation, or
the time period of the pendulum.
Is the time period of your pendulum
nearly the same in all cases?
Note that a slight change in the initial
displacement does not affect the time
period of your pendulum.

There is an interesting story about the discovery that the time period of a given
pendulum is constant. You might have heard the name of famous scientist
Galileo Galilie (A.D. 1564 –1642). It is said that once Galileo was sitting in a
church. He noticed that a lamp suspended from the ceiling with a chain was
moving slowly from one side to the other. He was surprised to find that his
pulse beat the same number of times during the interval in which the lamp
completed one oscillation. Galileo experimented with various pendulums to
verify his observation. He found that a pendulum of a given length takes always
the same time to complete one oscillation. This observation led to the
development of pendulum clocks. Winding clocks and wristwatches were
refinements of the pendulum clocks.

Many time measuring devices were
used in different parts of the world before
the pendulum clocks became popular.
Sundials, water clocks and sand clocks
are some examples of such devices.
Different designs of these devices were
developed in different parts of the world
(Fig. 13.5).

13.4 MEASURING SPEED

Having learnt how to measure time and
distance, you can calculate the speed of
an object. Let us find the speed of a ball
moving along the ground.

Different units of time are used
depending on the need. For example, it
is convenient to express your age in
years rather than in days or hours.
Similarly, it will not be wise to express
in years the time taken by you to cover
the distance between your home and
your school.
How small or large is a time interval
of one second? The time taken in saying
aloud “two thousand and one” is nearby
one second. Verify it by counting aloud
from "two thousand and one" to "two
thousand and ten". The pulse of a
normal healthy adult at rest beats about
72 times in a minute that is about 12
times in 10 seconds. This rate may be
slightly higher for children.

Paheli wondered how time was
measured when pendulum
clocks were not available.

Activity 13.3

Draw a straight line on the ground with
chalk powder or lime and ask one of
your friends to stand 1 to 2 m away from
it. Let your friend gently roll a ball along
the ground in a direction perpendicular
to the line. Note the time at the moment
the ball crosses the line and also when
it comes to rest (Fig. 13.6). How much
time does the ball take to come to rest?

no

tt

The smallest time interval that can be measured with commonly available
clocks and watches is one second. However, now special clocks are available
that can measure time intervals smaller than a second. Some of these clocks
can measure time intervals as small as one millionth or even one billionth of a
second. You might have heard the terms like microsecond and nanosecond.
One microsecond is one millionth of a second. A nanosecond is one billionth
of a second. Clocks that measure such small time intervals are used for scientific
research. The time measuring devices used in sports can measure time intervals
that are one tenth or one hundredth of a second. On the other hand, times of
historical events are stated in terms of centuries or millenniums. The ages of
stars and planet are often expressed in billions of years. Can you imagine the
range of time intervals that we have to deal with?

speed of the ball.
You may now like to compare your
speed of walking or cycling with that of

the speeds in m/s yourself.
Rockets, launching satellites into
earth’s orbit, often attain speeds up to
8 km/s. On the other hand, a tortoise
can move only with a speed of about 8
cm/s. Can you calculate how fast is the
rocket compared with the tortoise?
Once you know the speed of an
object, you can find the distance moved
by it in a given time. All you have to do
is to multiply the speed by time. Thus,
Distance covered = Speed × Time
You can also find the time an object
would take to cover a distance while
moving with a given speed.

known as the origin O. The two

we show the time along the x-axis
and the distance along the y-axis.
Choose a scale to represent the
distance and another to represent
the time on the graph. For the motion
of the car scales could be
Time: 1 min = 1 cm
Distance: 1 km = 1 cm
Mark values for the time and the
distance on the respective axes
according to the scale you have
chosen. For the motion of the car
mark the time 1 min, 2 min, … on
the x-axis from the origin O.
Similarly, mark the distance 1 km,
2 km … on the y-axis (Fig. 13.12).
Now you have to mark the points on
the graph paper to represent each
set of values for distance and time.
Observation recorded at S. No. 1
in Table 13.6 shows that at time
0 min the distance moved is also
zero. The point corresponding to this
set of values on the graph will
therefore be the origin itself. After 1
minute, the car has moved a distance
of 1 km. To mark this set of values
look for the point that represents
1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a line
parallel to the y-axis at this point.
Then draw a line parallel to the
x-axis from the point corresponding
to distance 1 km on the y-axis. The
point where these two lines
intersect represents this set of values
on the graph (Fig. 13.12). Similarly,
mark on the graph paper the

sets of values.

Generally, the choice of scales is not
as simple as in the example given above.
We may have to choose two different scales
to represent the desired quantities on the
x-axis and the y-axis. Let us try to
understand this process with an example.
Let us again consider the motion of
the bus that took Paheli and her friends
to the picnic. The distance covered and
time taken by the bus are shown in
Table 13.5. The total distance covered
by the bus is 80 km. If we decide to
choose a scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall
have to draw an axis of length 80 cm.
This is not possible on a sheet of paper.
On the other hand, a scale 10 km = 1
cm would require an axis of length only
8 cm. This scale is quite convenient.
However, the graph may cover only a
small part of the graph paper. Some of
the points to be kept in mind while
choosing the most suitable scale for
drawing a graph are:
154



the difference between the highest
and the lowest values of each
quantity.
 the intermediate values of each
quantity, so that with the scale
chosen it is convenient to mark the
values on the graph, and
 to utilise the maximum part of the
paper on which the graph is to be
drawn.
Suppose that we have a graph paper
of size 25 cm × 25 cm. One of the scales
which meets the above conditions and
can accommodate the data of Table 13.5
could be
Distance: 5 km = 1 cm, and
Time: 6 min = 1 cm

point A. We then mark the point, T, on
the graph at which this perpendicular
line intersects it (Fig. 13.14). Next, we
draw a line through the point T parallel
to the x-axis. This intersects the y-axis
at the point B. The distance
corresponding to the point B on the
y-axis, OB, gives us the distance in km
covered by the bus at 8:15 AM. How
much is this distance in km? Can you
now help Paheli to find the distance

1. You can make your own sundial and use it to mark the time of the day
at your place. First of all find the latitude of your city with the help of an
atlas. Cut out a triangular piece of a cardboard such that its one angle
is equal to the latitude of your place and the angle opposite to it is a
right angle. Fix this piece, called gnomon, vertically along a diameter of
a circular board a shown in Fig. 13.16. One way to fix the gnomon could
be to make a groove along a diameter on the circular board.
Next, select an open space, which receives sunlight for most of the day.
Mark a line on the ground along the North-South direction. Place the
sundial in the sun as shown in Fig. 13.16. Mark the position of the tip
of the shadow of the gnomon on the circular board as early in the day
as possible, say 8:00 AM. Mark the position of the tip of the shadow
every hour throughout the day. Draw lines to connect each point marked
by you with the centre of the base of the gnomon as shown in Fig. 13.16.
Extend the lines on the circular board up to its periphery. You can use
this sundial to read the time of the day at your place. Remember that
the gnomon should always be placed in the North-South direction as
shown in Fig. 13.16.

ancient times in different parts of the world. Prepare a brief write up on
each one of them. The write up may include the name of the device, the
place of its origin, the period when it was used, the unit in which the time
was measured by it and a drawing or a photograph of the device, if
available.

4. You can perform an interesting activity when you visit a park to ride a
swing. You will require a watch. Make the swing oscillate without
anyone sitting on it. Find its time period in the same way as you did for
the pendulum. Make sure that there are no jerks in the motion of the
swing. Ask one of your friends to sit on the swing. Push
it once and let it swing naturally. Again measure its time period.
Repeat the activity with different persons sitting on the swing. Compare
the time period of the swing measured in different cases. What
conclusions do you draw from this activity?

The time-keeping services in India are provided by the National Physical
Laboratory, New Delhi. The clock they use can measure time intervals
with an accuracy of one-millionth of a second. The most accurate clock
in the world has been developed by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology in the U.S.A. This clock will lose or gain one second after
running for 20 million years.
