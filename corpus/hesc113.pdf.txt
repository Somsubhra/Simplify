SOUND

H

ow do you come to know that a
‘period’ is over in your school?
You come to know easily that
someone is at your door when he knocks
or you hear the sound of the doorbell.
Most of the time you can make out that
someone is approaching you by just
hearing the foot steps.
You might have played a game called
hide and seek. In this game a person is
blind-folded and has to catch the
remaining players. How is the blindfolded person able to guess which player
is closest to her?

Sound plays an important role in our
life. It helps us to communicate with one
another. We hear a variety of sounds in
our surroundings.
Make a list of sounds you hear in
your surroundings.
In the music room of your school you
hear the sounds made by musical
instruments like flute, tabla,
harmonium etc. (Fig 13.1).
How is sound produced? How does it
travel from one place to another ? How
do we hear sound? Why are some sounds
louder than others? We shall discuss
such questions in this chapter.

Vibrating Body
Touch the school bell when not in use.
What do you feel? Again touch it when
producing sound. Can you feel it
vibrating?

Activity 13.1
Take a metal plate (or a shallow
frying pan). Hang it at a convenient
place in such a way that it does not
touch any wall. Now strike it with a
stick (Fig.13.2). Touch the plate or
pan gently with your finger. Do you
feel the vibrations?

Activity 13.2
Take a rubber band. Put it around
the longer side of a pencil box
(Fig. 13.3). Insert two pencils
between the box and the stretched
rubber. Now, pluck the rubber band
somewhere in the middle. Do you
hear any sound? Does the band
vibrate?

Fig. 13.3 : Plucking the rubber band

The to and fro or back and forth
motion of an object is termed as
vibration as you learnt in Class VII.
When a tightly stretched band is
plucked, it vibrates and produces
sound. When it stops vibrating, it does
not produce any sound.

Again strike the plate with the stick
and hold it tightly with your hands
immediately after striking. Do you
still hear the sound? Touch the
plate after it stops producing sound.
Can you feel the vibrations now?

Take a metal dish. Pour water in it.
Strike it at its edge by a spoon (Fig.
13.4). Do you hear a sound? Again
strike the plate and then touch it.
Can you feel the dish vibrating?
Strike the dish again. Look at the
surface of water. Do you see any
waves there? Now hold the dish.
What change do you observe on the
surface of water? Can you explain
the change? Is there a hint to
connect sound with the vibrations
of a body?

We see that a vibrating object
produces sound. In some cases, the

Activity 13.5
Take 6-8 metal bowls or tumblers.
Fill them with water up to different
levels, increasing gradually from
one end to the other. Now take
a pencil and strike the bowls gently.
Strike all of them in succession. You
will hear a pleasant sound. This is
your Jaltrang (Fig.13.7).

When we speak, does
any part of our body
vibrate?

13.2 Sound Produced by
Humans

d
e

Speak loudly for a while or sing a song,
or buzz like a bee. Put your hand on
your throat as shown in Fig. 13.8. Do
you feel any vibrations?
In humans, the sound is produced
by the voice box or the larynx. Put your
fingers on the throat and find a hard
bump that seems to move when you
swallow. This part of the body is known
as the voice box. It is at the upper end
of the windpipe. Two vocal cords, are
stretched across the voice box or larynx
in such a way that it leaves a narrow
slit between them for the passage of air
(Fig.13.8).

Fig. 13.7 : Jaltrang

When we pluck the string of an
instrument, like the sitar, the sound
that we hear is not only that of the
string. The whole instrument is forced
to vibrate, and it is the sound of the
vibration of the instrument that we
hear. Similarly, when we strike the
membrane of a mridangam, the sound
that we hear is not only that of the
membrane but of the whole body of
the instrument.

o

162

Fig.13.8 : Voice box in humans

When the lungs force air through the
slit, the vocal cords vibrate, producing
sound. Muscles attached to the vocal
cords can make the cords tight or loose.
When the vocal cords are tight and thin,
the type or quality of voice is different
SCIENCE

from that when they are loose and
thick. Let us see how the vocal cords
function.

Activity 13.6
Take two rubber strips of the same
size. Place these two pieces one
above the other and stretch them
tight. Now blow air through the gap
between them [Fig. 13.9(a)]. As the
air blows through the stretched
rubber strips, a sound is produced.
You can also take a piece of paper
with a narrow slit and hold it
between your fingers as shown in
Fig. 13.9 (b). Now blow through the
slit and listen to the sound. Our
vocal cords produce sound in a
similar manner.

The vocal cords in men are about
20mm long. In women these are about
5mm shorter. Children have very
short vocal cords. This is the reason
why the voices of men, women and
children are different.

Indicate to your friend to give a ring
again. Listen to the ring while
sucking air from the tumbler.
Does the sound become fainter
as you suck?
Remove the tumbler from your
mouth. Does the sound become
loud again?
Can you think of an explanation? Is
it possible that the decreasing amount
of air in the tumbler had something to
do with decreasing loudness of the ring?
Indeed, if you had been able to suck
all the air in the tumbler, the sound would
stop completely. Actually, sound needs a
medium to travel. When air has been
removed completely from a vessel, it is said
that there is vacuum in the vessel. The
sound cannot travel through vacuum.
Does sound travel in liquids? Let us
find out.

Place your ear gently on the water
surface (Fig. 13.11). (Be careful :
water should not enter in your ear).
Can you hear the sound of the bell?
Does it indicate that sound can

activity by placing your ear at one end
of a long wooden or metallic table and
asking your friend to gently scratch the
other end of the table (Fig. 13.13).

13.4 We hear Sound through
Our Ears
The shape of the outer part of the ear is
like a funnel. When sound enters in it,
it travels down a canal at the end of
which a thin membrane is stretched
tightly. It is called the eardrum. It
performs an important function. To
understand what the eardrum does, let
us build a tin can model of the eardrum.

Fig. 13.13 : Sound can travel through solids

We find that sound can travel
through wood or metal. In fact, sound
can travel through any solid. You can
perform interesting activities to show
that sound can also travel through
strings. Recall if you made a toy
telephone (Fig. 13.14). Can you say that
the sound can travel through strings?

d
e

Take a tin can. Cut its ends. Stretch
a piece of rubber balloon across one
end of the can and fasten it with a
rubber band. Put four or five grains
of dry cereal on the stretched rubber.
Now ask your friend to speak
“Hurrey, Hurrey” from the open end
(Fig.13.15). Observe what happens
to the grain. Why do the grains
jump up and down?

o
n

Fig. 13.14 : A toy telephone

We have learnt so far that vibrating
objects produce sound and it is carried
in all directions in a medium. How do
we hear it?
SOUND

Fig. 13.15 : Tin can eardrum
165

The eardrum is like a stretched
rubber sheet. Sound vibrations make
the eardrum vibrate (Fig. 13.16). The
eardrum sends vibrations to the inner
ear. From there, the signal goes to the
brain. That is how we hear.

You have already learnt in earlier classes
about the oscillatory motion and its
time period.
The number of oscillations per
second is called the frequency of
oscillation. Frequency is expressed in
hertz. Its symbol is Hz. A frequency of
1 Hz is one oscillation per second. If an
object oscillates 20 times in one second,
what would be its frequency?
You can recognise many familiar
sounds without seeing the objects
producing them. How is it possible?
These sounds must be different to
enable you to recognise them. Have you
ever thought what factors make them
different? Amplitude and frequency are
two important properties of any sound.
Can we differentiate sounds on the basis
of their amplitudes and frequencies?

Take a metallic tumbler and a

13.5 Amplitude, Time Period
And Frequency Of A
Vibration

We have learnt that the to and fro motion
of an object is known as vibration. This
motion is also called oscillatory motion.
166

Fig. 13.17 : Thermocole ball touching the
vibrating glass tumbler
SCIENCE

Hear the sound produced. Now bang
the spoon on the tumbler and hear
the sound produced again. Is the
sound louder when the tumbler is
struck hard?
Now suspend a small thermocole
ball touching the rim of the tumbler
(Fig. 13.17). Vibrate the tumbler by
striking it. See how far the ball is
displaced. The displacement of the
ball is a measure of the amplitude
of vibration of the tumbler.
Now, strike the tumbler gently
and then with some force. Compare
the amplitudes of vibrations of the
tumbler in the two cases. In which
case is the amplitude larger?

Compare the sound of a baby with
that of an adult. Is there any difference?
Even if two sounds are equally loud,
they differ in some way. Let us see how.

I wonder why my voice
is different from that of
my teacher.

d
e

The frequency determines the
shrillness or pitch of a sound. If the
frequency of vibration is higher we say
that the sound is shrill and has a higher
pitch. If the frequency of vibration is
lower, we say that the sound has a lower
pitch. For example, a drum vibrates with
a low frequency. Therefore, it produces

Loudness of sound is proportional to
the square of the amplitude of the
vibration producing the sound. For
example, if the amplitude becomes
twice, the loudness increases by a
factor of 4. The loudness is expressed
in a unit called decibel (dB). The
following table gives some idea of the
loudness of sound coming from
various sources.

Above 80 dB the noise becomes

The loudness of sound depends on
its amplitude. When the amplitude of
vibration is large, the sound produced
is loud. When the amplitude is small,
the sound produced is feeble.

hand, a whistle has a high frequency
and therefore, produces a sound of
higher pitch (Fig. 13.18). A bird makes
a high-pitched sound whereas a lion
makes a low-pitched roar. However, the
roar of a lion is very loud while the
sound of the bird is quite feeble.
Every day you hear the voices of
children and adults. Do you find any
difference in their voices? Can you say
that the frequency of the voice of a child
is higher than that of an adult? Usually
the voice of a woman has a higher
frequency and is shriller than that of a
man.

13.7 Noise and Music
We hear different types of sounds
around us. Is the sound always
pleasing? Does a sound sometimes
cause discomfort to you? Some sounds
are pleasant to the ear, whereas some
are not.
Suppose construction work is going
on in your neighbourhood. Are the
sounds coming from the construction
site pleasing? Do you enjoy the sounds
produced by horns of buses and trucks?
Such unpleasant sounds are called
noise. In a classroom, if all the students
speak together, what would the sound
produced be called?
On the other hand you enjoy sounds
from musical instruments. Musical
sound is one which is pleasing to the
ear. Sound produced by a harmonium
is a musical sound. The string of a sitar
also gives out a musical sound. But, if
a musical sound becomes too loud,
would it remain melodious?

13.6 Audible and Inaudible
Sounds

We know that we need a vibrating body
for the production of sound. Can we
hear the sound of all vibrating bodies?
The fact is that sounds of frequencies
less than about 20 vibrations per second
(20 Hz) cannot be detected by the human
ear. Such sounds are called inaudible.
On the higher side, sounds of frequencies
higher than about 20,000 vibrations per
second (20 kHz) are also not audible to
the human ear. Thus, for human ear,
the range of audible frequencies is
roughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz.

o
n

Some animals can hear sounds of
frequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.
Dogs have this ability. The police use
high frequency whistles which dogs can
hear but humans cannot.
The ultrasound equipment, familiar
to us for investigating and tracking
many medical problems, works at
frequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.

13.8 Noise Pollution
You already know about air pollution.
Presence of unwanted gases and
particles in air is called air pollution.
Similarly, presence of excessive or
unwanted sounds in the environment
is called noise pollution. Can you list
some sources of noise pollution? Major
causes of noise pollution are sounds of
vehicles, explosions including bursting
of crackers, machines, loudspeakers etc.
What sources in the home may lead to
noise? Television and transistor radio
at high volumes, some kitchen
appliances, desert coolers, air
conditioners, all contribute to noise
pollution.
SCIENCE

What are the harms of noise
pollution?
Do you know that presence of
excessive noise in the surroundings may
cause many health related problems.
Lack of sleep, hypertension (high bloodpressure), anxiety and many more health
disorders may be caused by noise
pollution. A person who is exposed to a
loud sound continuously may get
temporary or even permanent
impairment of hearing.

must be installed in air craft engines,
transport vehicles, industrial
machines and home appliances.
How can the noise pollution be
controlled in a residential area?
The noisy operations must be
conducted away from any residential
area. Noise producing industries
should be set up away from such
areas. Use of automobile horns
should be minimised. TV and music
systems should be run at low
volumes. Trees must be planted along
the roads and around buildings to
cut down on the sounds reaching the
residents, thus reducing the harmful
effects of noise pollution.

Hearing Impairment

The total hearing imparment, which is rare, is usually from birth itself. Partial
disability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age. Children with impaired
hearing need special care. By learning sign language, such children can
communicate effectively. Because speech develops as the direct result of hearing,
a child with a hearing loss may have defective speech also. Technological devices
for the hearing-impared have made it possible for such persons to improve their
quality of life. Society can do much to improve the living environment for the
hearing-impaired and help them live normal lives.

Golconda fort, near Hyderabad, is one of the most magnificient
forts in India. It is famous for many engineering and architectural
marvels. One of the marvels is the water supply system. But,
perhaps, more astonishing is a dome near the entrance to the fort.
A hand-clap at a particular point under the dome reverberates
and can be heard at the highest point of the fort, about a kilometre
away. This was devised as a warning system. If a guard saw a
suspicious movement outside the fort, he clapped at the particular
point under the dome, and the army inside the fort was alerted to
the danger of the approaching enemy.
