Sorting Materials into Groups

4.1 OBJECTS AROUND

US

We saw that our food and clothes have
so much variety in them. Not just food
and clothes, there is such a vast variety
of objects everywhere. We see around us,
a chair, a bullock cart, a cycle, cooking
utensils, books, clothes, toys, water,
stones and many other objects. All these
objects have different shapes, colours
and uses (Fig. 4.1).
Look around and identify objects
that are round in shape. Our list may
include a rubber ball, a football and a
glass marble. If we include objects that
are nearly round, our list could also
include objects like apples, oranges, and
an earthen pitcher (gharha). Suppose

we were looking for objects that are
edible. We might include all the items
that we have listed in Tables 1.1, 1.2
and 1.3 in Chapter 1. We might also
find that some of those round shaped
objects we just listed out, are also in
this group.
Let us say, we wish to make a group
of objects that are made of plastics.
Buckets, lunch boxes, toys, water
containers, pipes and many such
objects, may find a place in this group.
There are so many ways to group objects!
In the above examples we have grouped
objects on the basis of their shape or the
materials they are made from.
All objects around us are made of one
or more materials. These materials may
be glass, metal, plastics, wood, cotton,
paper, mud or soil. Can you think of
more examples of materials?

Activity 1

Let us collect as many objects as
possible, from around us. Each of us
could get some everyday objects from
home and we could also collect some
objects from the classroom or from
outside the school. What will we have
in our collection? Chalk, pencil,
notebook, rubber, duster, a hammer,
nail, soap, spoke of a wheel, bat,
SCIENCE

matchbox, salt, potato! We can also list
objects that we can think of, but, cannot
bring to the classroom. For example,
wall, trees, doors, tractor, road.
Separate all objects from this
collection that are made from paper or
wood. This way we have divided all objects
into two groups. One group has the
objects that are made from paper or wood
while the other group has the objects
that are not made of these materials.
Similarly, we could separate the things
that are used for preparing food.
Let us be a little more systematic. List
all objects collected, in Table 4.1. Try to
identify the materials that each one is
made of. It would be fun to make this a
large table – collecting information
about as many objects as possible. It
may seem difficult to find out the
materials out of which some of these
objects are made. In such cases, discuss
with your friends, teacher and parents
to identify the materials.

Boojho wants to know, whether
we found some materials that
were used for making more than
one type of an object.

What do we find from these tables?
First, we grouped objects in many
different ways. We then found that
objects around us are made of different
materials. At times, an object is made of
a single material. An object could also
be made of many materials. And then
again, one material could be used for
making many different objects. What
decides which material should be used
27

for making any given object? It seems
that we need to know more about
different materials.

4.2 PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS
Have you ever wondered why a tumbler
is not made with a piece of cloth? Recall
our experiments with pieces of cloth in
Chapter 3 and also keep in mind that
we generally use a tumbler to keep a
liquid. Therefore, would it not be silly,
if we were to make a tumbler out of cloth
(Fig 4.2)! What we need for a tumbler is
glass, plastics, metal or other such
material that will hold water. Similarly,
it would not be wise to use paper-like
materials for cooking vessels.

Appearance
Materials usually look different from
each other. Wood looks very different
from iron. Iron appears different from
copper or aluminium. At the same time,
there may be some similarities between
iron, copper and aluminium that are not
there in wood.

Collect small pieces of different materials –
paper, cardboard, wood, copper wire,
aluminium sheet, chalk. Do any of these
appear shiny? Separate the shiny
materials into a group.
Now, observe as the teacher cuts each
material into two pieces and look at the
freshly cut surface (Fig. 4.3). What do
you notice? Does the freshly cut surface
of some of these materials appear shiny?
Include these objects also in the group
of shiny materials.
Do you notice such a shine or lustre
in the other materials, cut them anyway
as you can? Repeat this in the class with
as many materials as possible and make
a list of those with and without lustre.
Instead of cutting, you can rub the
surface of material with sand paper to
see if it has lustre.

Fig. 4.2 Using a cloth tumbler

We see then, that we choose a
material to make an object depending
on its properties, and the purpose for
which the object is to be used.
So, what are all the properties of
materials that would be important for
their usage? Some properties are
discussed here.

Activity 3

Fig. 4.3 Cutting pieces of materials to see if they
have lustre
SCIENCE

Materials that have such lustre are
usually metals. Iron, copper, aluminium
and gold are examples of metals. Some
metals often lose their shine and
appear dull, because of the action of air
and moisture on them. We therefore,
notice the lustre, only on their freshly
cut sur face. When you visit an
ironsmith or a workshop, look out for
freshly cut surfaces of metal rods to see
if they have lustre.

beakers. Fill each one of them about twothirds with water. Add a small amount
(spoonful) of sugar to the first glass,
salt to the second and similarly, add
small amounts of the other substances
into the other glasses. Stir the contents
of each of them with a spoon. Wait for a
few minutes. Observe what happens to
the substances added to water (Fig. 4.4).
Note your observations as shown
in Table 4.3.

When you press different materials with
your hands, some of them may be hard
to compress while others can be easily
compressed. Take a metal key and try
to scratch with it, the surface of a piece
of wood, aluminium, a piece of stone, a
nail, candle, chalk, any other material
or object. You can easily scratch some
materials, while some cannot be
scratched so easily. Materials which can
be compressed or scratched easily are
called soft while some other materials
which are difficult to compress are called
hard. For example, cotton or sponge is
soft while iron is hard.
In appearance, materials can have
different properties, like lustre,
hardness, be rough or smooth. Can you
think of other properties that describe
the appearance of a material?

You will notice that some substances
have completely disappeared or
dissolved in water. We say that these
substances are soluble in water. Other
substances do not mix with water and
do not disappear even after we stir for a
29

long time. These substances are
insoluble in water.
Water plays an important role in the
functioning of our body because it can
dissolve a large number of substances.
Do liquids also dissolve in water?

We notice that some liquids get
completely mixed with water. Some
others do not mix with water and form
a separate layer when kept aside for
some time.

Activity 5
Collect samples of vinegar, lemon juice,
mustard oil or coconut oil, kerosene or
any other liquid. Take a glass tumbler.
Fill it up to half with water. Add a few
spoonfuls of one liquid to this and stir
it well. Let it stand for five minutes.
Observe whether the liquid mixes with
water (Fig. 4.5). Repeat the same with
other liquids, as many different liquids
as are available to you. Write your
observations in Table 4.4.

common liquids in water

Kerosene

Boojho suggests that we
also check if the liquids that we
used in Activity 5, mix well with
some liquid other than water.
Paheli is curious to know
whether gases also dissolve
in water.

Some gases are soluble in water
whereas others are not. Water, usually,
has small quantities of some gases
dissolved in it. For example, oxygen gas
dissolved in water is very important for
the survival of animals and plants that
live in water.

Objects may float or sink in
water
While doing Activity 4, you might have
noticed that the insoluble solids
separated out from water. You may have
also noticed this with some liquids in
Activity 5. Some of these materials that
did not mix with water, floated to the
surface of water. Others may have sunk
to the bottom of the tumbler, right? We
notice many examples of objects that
float in water or sink (Fig. 4.6). Dried
leaves fallen on the surface of a pond, a
stone that you throw into this pond, few

hide behind a glass window? Obviously
not, as your friends can see through that
and spot you. Can you see through all
the materials? Those substances or
materials, through which things can be
seen, are called transparent (Fig. 4.7).
Glass, water, air and some plastics are
examples of transparent materials.
Shopkeepers usually prefer to keep
biscuits, sweets and other eatables in
transparent containers of glass or

Transparency

You might have played the game of hide
and seek. Think of some places where
you would like to hide so that you are
not seen by others. Why did you choose
those places? Would you have tried to

plastic, so that buyers can easily see
these items (Fig. 4.8).
On the other hand, there are some
materials through which you are not
able to see. These materials are called
opaque. You cannot tell what is kept
in a closed wooden box, a cardboard
carton or a metal container. Wood,
cardboard and metals, are examples of
opaque materials.
Do we find that we can group all
materials and objects, without any
confusion, as either opaque or
transparent?

Activity 6
Take a sheet of paper and look through
it towards a lighted bulb. Make a note
of your observation. Now, put 2-3 drops
31

of some oil and spread it on the sheet of
paper. Look again towards the lighted
bulb through that portion of the paper
on which the oil has been spread. Do
you find that the bulb is more clearly
visible than before? But, can you see
clearly through the oiled paper? Is
everything on the other side of it visible?
Perhaps not. The materials through
which objects can be seen, but not
clearly, are known as translucent.
Remember the oily patch on paper when
we tested food items for presence of fats?
That was translucent too! Can you
think of some more examples of
translucent materials?
We can therefore group materials as
opaque, transparent and translucent.

light pass through

She wants to know

We learnt that materials differ in their
appearance and the way they mix in
water or other liquids. They may float
or sink in water or may be transparent,
opaque or translucent. Materials can be
grouped on the basis of similarities or
differences in their properties.
Why do we need to group materials?
In everyday life, we often group materials
for our convenience. At home, we
usually store things in such a manner
that similar objects are placed together.
Such an arrangement helps us to locate
them easily. Similarly, a grocer usually
keeps all type of biscuits at one corner
of his shop, all soaps at another while
grains and pulses are stored at some
other place.
There is another reason why we find
such grouping useful. Dividing
materials in groups makes it convenient
to study their properties and also
observe any patterns in these properties.
We will study more about this in
higher classes.

Different types of materials have different properties.



Some materials are shiny in appearance while others are not. Some are
rough, some smooth. Similarly, some materials are hard, whereas some
others are soft.



Some materials are soluble in water whereas some others are insoluble.



Some materials such as glass, are transparent and some others such
as wood and metals are opaque. Some materials are translucent.

SUGGESTED ACTIVITY
1.

You may have played a memory game with your friends. Several objects are
placed on a table, you are asked to observe them for a few minutes, go into
another room and write down the names of all objects that you can remember.
Play this game, with a difference! Ask all the participants in the game to
remember objects with some particular property while playing this memory
game — remember and write down the names of objects that were made of
wood or objects that are edible and so on. Have fun!

2.

From a large collection of materials, make groups of objects having different
properties like transparency, solubility in water and other properties. In later
chapters you will also learn about properties of materials related to electricity
and magnetism. After making different groups from the collected materials,
try and find out if there are any patterns in these groups. For instance, do all
materials which have lustre conduct electricity?
