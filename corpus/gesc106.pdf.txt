Activity 6.1
Cut a piece of paper in four square
pieces. Cut each square piece further
into four square pieces. Lay these pieces
on the floor or a table so that the pieces
acquire the shape of the original piece
of paper (Fig. 6.1).
Obviously, you cannot join the pieces
back to make the original piece, but is
there a change in the property of the
paper?

very day you come across many
changes in your surroundings.
These changes may involve one
or more substances. For example, your
mother may ask you to dissolve sugar
in water to make a cold drink. Making a
sugar solution is a change. Similarly,
setting curd from milk is a change.
Sometimes milk becomes sour. Souring
of milk is a change. Stretched rubber
band also represents a change.
Make a list of ten changes you have
noticed around you.
In this chapter we shall perform some
activities and study the nature of these
changes. Broadly, these changes are of
two kinds, physical and chemical.

Properties such as shape, size, colour
and state of a substance are called its
physical properties. A change in which
a substance undergoes a change in its
physical properties is called a physical
change. A physical change is generally
reversible. In such a change no new
substance is formed.
Let us now consider the other kind
of change.

6.2 CHEMICAL CHANGE

A change with which you are quite
familiar is the rusting of iron. If you
leave a piece of iron in the open for some
time, it acquires a film of brownish
substance. This substance is called rust
and the process is called rusting
(Fig. 6.2). Iron gates of parks or
farmlands, iron benches kept in lawns
and gardens, almost every article of iron,
kept in the open gets rusted. At home

A change in which one or more
new substances are formed is called a
chemical change. A chemical change
is also called a chemical reaction.
Chemical changes are very important
in our lives. All new substances are
formed as a result of chemical changes.
For example, if a metal is to be extracted
from an ore, such as iron from iron ore,
we need to carry out a series of chemical
changes. A medicine is the end product
of a chain of chemical reactions. Useful
new materials, such as plastics and
detergents, are produced by chemical
reactions. Indeed, every new material
is discovered by studying chemical
changes.
We have seen that one or more new
substances are produced in a chemical
change. In addition to new products,
the following may accompany a chemical
change:
 Heat, light or any other radiation
(ultraviolet, for example) may be given
off or absorbed.
 Sound may be produced.
 A change in smell may take place or
a new smell may be given off.
 A colour change may take place .
 A gas may be formed.
Let us look at some examples.
You saw that burning of magnesium
ribbon is a chemical change. Burning
of coal, wood or leaves is also a chemical
change. In fact, burning of any
substance is a chemical change.
Burning is always accompanied by
production of heat.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) + Lime water
[Ca(OH) 2 ] → Calcium Carbonate
(CaCO3) + Water (H2O)
When carbon dioxide is passed
through lime water, calcium carbonate
is formed, which makes lime water milky.
The turning of lime water into milky is a
standard test of carbon dioxide. You will
use it in Chapter 10 to show that the air
we breathe out is rich in carbon dioxide.
In Activities 6.6–6.8, you saw that
in each change one or more new
substances were formed. In Activity 6.6,
the ash was the new substance formed
when magnesium was burnt. In Activity 6.7,
the reaction of copper sulphate with iron
produced iron sulphate and copper.
Both of these are new substances.
Copper was deposited on the shaving
blade of iron. In Activity 6.8, vinegar and
baking soda together produced carbon
dioxide, which turned lime water milky.
Can you name the new substance
formed in this reaction?

Explosion of a firework is a chemical
change. You know that such an
explosion produces heat, light, sound
and unpleasant gases that pollute the
atmosphere. That is why you are advised
not to play with fireworks.
When food gets spoiled, it produces
a foul smell. Shall we call this change a
chemical change?
You must have noticed that a slice of
an apple acquires a brown colour if it is
not consumed immediately. If you have
not seen this change in colour, cut a
fresh slice of apple and keep it away for
some time. Repeat the same activity with
a slice of potato or brinjal. The change
of colour in these cases is due to the
formation of new substances. Are not
these changes chemical changes?
In Chapter 5, you neutralised an acid

You must have heard of the ozone layer
in our atmosphere. It protects us from
the harmful ultraviolet radiation which
come from the sun. Ozone absorbs this
radiation and breaks down to oxygen.
Oxygen is different from ozone. Can
we call the breaking down of ozone a
chemical change?
If ultraviolet radiation were not
absorbed by ozone, it would reach the
earth’s surface and cause harm to us
and other life forms. Ozone acts as a
natural shield against this radiation.

6.3 RUSTING

OF

IRON

Let us get back to rusting. This is one
change that affects iron articles and
slowly destroys them. Since iron is used
in making bridges, ships, cars, truck
bodies and many other articles, the
monetary loss due to rusting is huge.
The process of rusting can be
represented by the following equation:
Iron (Fe) + Oxygen (O2, from the air)
+ water (H2O) → rust (iron oxide Fe2O3)
For rusting, the presence of both
oxygen and water (or water vapour)
is essential.
In fact, if the content of moisture in
air is high, which means if it is more
humid, rusting becomes faster.
So, how do we prevent rusting?
Prevent iron articles from coming in
contact with oxygen, or water, or both.
One simple way is to apply a coat of
paint or grease. In fact, these coats
should be applied regularly to prevent
rusting. Another way is to deposit a layer
of a metal like chromium or zinc on iron.

This process of depositing a layer of zinc
on iron is called galvanisation. The iron
pipes we use in our homes to carry water
are galvanised to prevent rusting.
You know that ships are made of iron
and a part of them remains under water.
On the part above water also, water
drops keep clinging to the ship’s outer
surface. Moreover, the water of the sea
contains many salts. The salt water
makes the process of rust formation
faster. Therefore, ships suffer a lot of
damage from rusting in spite of being

and add a few drops of dilute sulphuric

be dissolved. Filter the solution. Allow
it to cool. Do not disturb the solution
when it is cooling. Look at the solution
after some time. Can you see the crystals
of copper sulphate? If not, wait for some
more time.

Changes can be of two types, physical and chemical.

Physical changes are changes in the physical properties of substances.
No new substances are formed in these changes. These changes may
be reversible.
In chemical changes new substances are produced.

Some substances can be obtained in pure state from their solutions by
crystallisation.
