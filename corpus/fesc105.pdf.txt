Separation of Substances

T

here are many instances when we
notice a substance being
separated from a mixture
of materials.
Tea leaves are separated from the
liquid with a strainer, while preparing
tea (Fig. 5.1).

Fig. 5.2 Butter is taken out by churning milk or
curds

Fig. 5.1 Separating tea leaves with a strainer

Grain is separated from stalks, while
harvesting. Milk or curd is churned to
separate the butter (Fig. 5.2). As we
learned in Chapter 3, we gin cotton to
separate its seeds from the fibre.
Perhaps you might
have eaten salted
daliya or poha. If you
found that it had
chillies in it, you may
have carefully taken
them out before eating.
Suppose you are given a basket
containing mangoes and guavas and
asked to separate them. What would you
do? Pick out one kind and place them
in a separate container, right?
Seems easy, but what if the materials
we want to separate are much smaller

than mango or guava? Imagine you are
given a glass of sand with salt mixed in
it. Impossible, even to think of
separating salt from this mixture by
picking out grains of sand by hand!
But, why would we need to
separate substances like this
at all, is what Paheli wants
to know.

Activity 1
In Column 1 of Table 5.1, are given a
few processes of separation. The purpose
of separation and the way separated
components are used is mentioned in
Column 2 and 3 respectively. However,
the information given in Columns 2 and
3 is jumbled up. Can you match each

process with its purpose and the way
separated components are used?
We see that, befor e we use a
substance, we need to separate harmful
or non-useful substances that may be
mixed with it. Sometimes, we separate
even useful components if we need to
use them separately.
The substances to be separated may
be particles of different sizes or
materials. These may be solids, liquids
or even gases. So, how do we separate
substances mixed together if they have
so many different properties?

of paper? Are there pieces of stone,
husks, broken grain and particles of any
other grain in it? Now, remove with your
hand the pieces of stone, husks and
other grains from it.
This method of handpicking can
be used for separating slightly larger
sized impurities like the pieces of dirt,
stone, and husk from wheat, rice or
pulses (Fig. 5.3). The quantity of such
impurities is usually not very large.
In such situations, we find that
handpicking is a convenient method of
separating substances.

5.1 METHODS OF SEPARATION
We will discuss some simple methods of
separating substances that are mixed
together. You may come across some of
these methods being used in day to day
activities.

Hand Picking
Activity 2
Fig. 5.3 Handpicking stones from grain

Bring a packet of grain purchased from
a shop to the classroom. Now, spread
the grain on a sheet of paper. Do you
find only one kind of grain on the sheet
36

Threshing
You must have seen bundles of wheat
or paddy stalks lying in fields after
S CIENCE

harvesting the crop. Stalks are dried in
the sun before the grain is separated
from them. Each stalk has many grain
seeds attached to it. Imagine the
number of grain seeds in hundreds of
bundles of stalk lying in the field! How
does the farmer separate grain seeds
from those bundles of stalks?
One may pluck mangoes or guavas
from the trees. But, grain seeds are
much smaller than mangoes or guavas.
So, plucking them from their stalks
would be impossible. How does one
separate grain seeds from their stalks?
The process that is used to separate
grain from stalks etc. is threshing. In
this process, the stalks are beaten to free
the grain seeds (Fig. 5.4). Sometimes,

this mixture on a plate or a newspaper.
Look at this mixture carefully. Can the
two different components be made out
easily? Are the sizes of particles of the
two components similar? Would it be
possible to separate the components by
handpicking?
Now, take your mixture to an open
ground and stand on a raised platform.
Put the mixture in a plate or sheet of
paper. Hold the plate or the sheet of
paper containing the mixture, at your
shoulder height. Tilt it slightly, so that
the mixture slides out slowly.
What happens? Do both the
components — sand and sawdust (or
powdered leaves) fall at the same place?
Is there a component that blows away?
Did the wind manage to separate the
two components?
This method of separating
components of a mixture is called
winnowing. Winnowing is used to
separate heavier and lighter components
of a mixture by wind or by blowing air.

Fig. 5.4 Threshing

threshing is done with the help of
bullocks. Machines are also used to
thresh large quantities of grain.

This method is commonly used by
farmers to separate lighter husk particles
from heavier seeds of grain (Fig. 5.5).
The husk particles are carried away
by the wind. The seeds of grain get
separated and form a heap near the
platform for winnowing. The separated
husk is used for many purposes such
as fodder for cattles.

Sieving
Sometimes, we may wish to prepare a
dish with flour. We need to remove
impurities and bran that may be present
in it. What do we do? We use a sieve
and pour the flour into it (Fig. 5.6).
Sieving allows the fine flour particles
to pass through the holes of the sieve
while the bigger impurities remain on
the sieve.
In a flour mill, impurities like husk
and stones are removed from wheat
before grinding it. Usually, a bagful of
wheat is poured on a slanting sieve. The
sieving removes pieces of stones, stalk
and husk that may still remain with
wheat after threshing and winnowing.

Fig. 5.6 Sieving

You may have also noticed similar
sieves being used at construction sites
38

Fig. 5.7 Pebbles and stones are removed from
sand by sieving

to separate pebbles and stones from
sand (Fig. 5.7).

Activity 4
Bring a sieve and a small quantity of
flour from home, to the class. Sieve the
flour to separate any impurities in it.
Now, make a fine powder of chalk pieces
and mix it with the flour. Can we
separate the flour and the powdered
chalk by sieving?
Sieving is used when components of
a mixture have different sizes.

Sedimentation, Decantation
and Filtration
Sometimes, it may not be possible to
separate components of a mixture by
winnowing and handpicking. For
example, there may be lighter impurities
like dust or soil particles in rice or
pulses. How are such impurities
separated from rice or pulses before
cooking?
Rice or pulses are usually washed
before cooking. When you add water to
these, the impurities like dust and soil
S CIENCE

particles get separated. These impurities
go into water, which becomes a little
muddy. Now, what will sink to the
bottom of the vessel — rice or dust?
Why? Have you seen that the vessel is
tilted to pour out the dirty water?
When the heavier component in a
mixture settles after water is added to
it, the process is called sedimentation.
When the water (along with the dust) is
removed, the process is called
decantation (Fig. 5.8). Let us find a
few other mixtures that can be separated
through
sedimentation
and
decantation.
The same principle is used for
separating a mixture of two liquids that
do not mix with each other. For example,
oil and water from their mixture can be
separated by this process. If a mixture of
such liquids is allowed to stand for some
time, they form two separate layers. The
component that forms the top layer can
then be separated by decantation.
Let us again consider a mixure of a
solid and liquid. After preparing tea,
what do you do to remove the tea leaves?
Try decantation. It helps a little. But,
do you still get a few leaves in your tea?
Now, pour the tea through a strainer.

Fig. 5.8 Separating two components of a mixture
by sedimentation and decantation
S EPARATION OF SUBSTANCES

Did all the tea leaves remain in the
strainer? This process is called filtration
(Fig. 5.1). Which method of separating
tea leaves from prepared tea is better,
decantation or filtration?
Let us now consider the example
of water that we use. Do all of us, at
all times, get safe water to drink?
Sometimes, water supplied through taps
may be muddy. The water collected from
ponds or rivers may also be muddy,
especially after rains. Let us see if we
can use some method of separation to
remove insoluble impurities like soil
from the water.

Activity 5
Collect some muddy water from a pond
or a river. If it is not available, mix some
soil to water in a glass. Let it stand for
half an hour. Observe the water
carefully and note your observations.
Does some soil settle at the bottom
of water? Why? What will you call this
process?
Now, slightly tilt the glass without
disturbing the water. Let the water from
the top flow into another glass (Fig. 5.8).
What will you call this process?
Is the water in the second glass still
muddy or brown in colour? Now filter
it. Did the tea strainer work? Let us try
filtering the water through a piece of
cloth. In a piece of cloth, small holes or
pores remain in between the woven
threads. These pores in a cloth can be
used as a filter.
If the water is still muddy, impurities
can be separated by a filter that has even
39

smaller pores. A filter paper is one such
filter that has very fine pores in it.
Fig. 5.9 shows the steps involved in
using a filter paper. A filter paper folded
in the form of a cone is fixed onto a
funnel (Fig. 5.10). The mixture is then
poured on the filter paper. Solid
particles in the mixture do not pass
through it and remain on the filter.

Fruit and vegetable juices are usually
filtered before drinking to separate the
seeds and solid particles of pulp. The
method of filtration is also used in the
process of preparing cottage cheese
(paneer) in our homes. You might have
seen that for making paneer, a few drops
of lemon juice are added to milk as it
boils. This gives a mixture of particles
of solid paneer and a liquid. The paneer
is then separated by filtering the mixture
through a fine cloth or a strainer.

Evaporation
Activity 6
Heat a beaker containing some water.
Allow the water to boil. If you continue
heating, would the water turn into steam
40

and disappear completely? Now, add two
spoons of salt to water in another beaker
and stir it well. Do you see any change
in the colour of water? Can you see any
salt in the beaker, after stirring? Heat
the beaker containing the salt water
(Fig. 5.11). Let the water boil away. What
is left in the beaker?
In this activity, we used the process
of evaporation, to separate a mixture of
water and salt.
The process of conversion of water
into its vapour is called evaporation.
The process of evaporation takes place
continuously wherever water is present.
Where do you think, salt comes
from? Sea water contains many salts
mixed in it. One of these salts is the
common salt. When sea water is allowed
to stand in shallow pits, water gets
heated by sunlight and slowly turns into
water vapour, through evaporation. In
a few days, the water evaporates
completely leaving behind the solid salts
(Fig. 5.12). Common salt is then
obtained from this mixture of salts by
further purification.

Fig. 5.12 Obtaining salt from sea water

Use of more than one method
of separation
We have studied some methods for
separation of substances from their
mixtures. Often, one method is not
sufficient to separate the different
substances present in a mixture. In such
a situation, we need to use more than
one of these methods.

Activity 7
Take a mixture of sand and salt. How
will we separate these? We already saw
that handpicking would not be a
practical method for separating these.
Keep this mixture in a beaker and
add some water to it. Leave the beaker
aside for some time. Do you see the sand
settling down at the bottom? The sand
can be separated by decantation or
filtration. What does the decanted liquid
contain? Do you think this water
contains the salt which was there in the
mixture at the beginning?
Now, we need to separate salt and
water from the decanted liquid. Transfer
this liquid to a kettle and close its lid.
Heat the kettle for some time. Do you
S EPARATION OF SUBSTANCES

notice steam coming out from the spout
of the kettle?
Take a metal plate with some ice on
it. Hold the plate just above the spout
of the kettle as shown in Fig. 5.13. What
do you observe? Let all the water in the
kettle boil off.
When the steam comes in contact
with the metal plate cooled with ice, it
condenses and forms liquid water. The
water drops that you observed falling
from the plate, were due to condensation
of steam. The process of conversion of
water vapour into its liquid form is
called condensation.
Did you ever see water drops
condensed under a plate that has been
used to cover a vessel containing milk
that has just been boiled?
After all the water has evaporated,
what is left behind in the kettle?
We have thus, separated salt, sand
and water using processes of
decantation, filtration, evaporation and
condensation.
Paheli faced a problem while
recovering salt mixed with sand. She
has mixed a packet of salt in a small

Fig. 5.13 Evaporation and condensation
41

amount of sand. She then tried the
method suggested in Activity 7, to
recover the salt. She found, however,
that she could recover only a small part
of the salt that she had taken. What
could have gone wrong?

Can water dissolve any
amount of a substance?
In chapter 4, we found that many
substances dissolve in water and form
a solution. We say that these substances
are soluble in water. What will happen
if we go on adding more and more of
these substances to a fixed quantity of
water?

Activity 8
You will need a beaker or a tumbler, a
spoon, salt and water. Pour half a cup
of water in the beaker. Add one
teaspoonful of salt and stir it well, until
the salt dissolves completely (Fig 5.14).
Again add a teaspoonful of salt and stir
well. Go on adding salt, one teaspoonful
at a time, and stir.
After adding a few spoons of salt, do
you find that some salt remains
undissolved and settles at the bottom
of the beaker? If yes, this means that
no more salt can be dissolved in the
amount of water we have taken. The
solution is now said to be saturated.
Here is a hint as to what might have
gone wrong when Paheli tried to recover
large quantity of salt mixed with sand.
Perhaps the quantity of salt was much
more than that required to form a
saturated solution. The undissolved salt
42

Fig 5.14 Dissolving salt in water

would have remained mixed with the
sand and could not be recovered. She
could solve her problem by using a
larger quantity of water.
Suppose, she did not have sufficient
quantity of water to dissolve all the salt
in the mixture. Is there some way that
water could be made to dissolve more
salt before the solution gets saturated?
Let us try and help Paheli out.

Activity 9
Take some water in a beaker and mix
salt in it until it cannot dissolve any
more salt. This will give you a saturated
solution of salt in water.
Now, add a small quantity of salt to
this saturated solution and heat it. What
do you find? What happens to the
undissolved salt in the bottom of the
beaker? Does it dissolve, now? If yes,
can some more salt be dissolved in this
solution by heating it?
Let this hot solution cool. Does the
salt appear to settle at the bottom of the
beaker again?
The activity suggest that larger
quantity of salt can be dissolved in water
on heating.

of different soluble substances? Let us
