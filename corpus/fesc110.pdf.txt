Motion and Measurement of
Distances

here was a general discussion
among the children in Paheli and
Boojho's class about the places
they had visited during the summer
vacations. Someone had gone to their
native village by a train, then a bus, and
finally a bullock cart. One student had
travelled by an aeroplane. Another spent
many days of his holidays going on
fishing trips in his uncle's boat.
The teacher then asked them to read
newspaper articles that mentioned
about small wheeled vehicles that moved
on the soil of Mars and conducted
experiments. These vehicles were taken
by spacecraft all the way to Mars!
Meanwhile, Paheli had been reading
stories about ancient India and wanted
to know how people travelled from one
place to another in earlier times.

10.1 STORY

imitated the shapes of the animals living
in water. Recall our discussions of this
streamlined shape of fish in Chapters
8 and 9.
Invention of the wheel made a great
change in modes of transport. The
design of the wheel was improved over
thousands of years. Animals were used
to pull vehicles that moved on wheels.
Until the beginning of the 19th
century, people still depended on
animal power to transport them from
place to place. The invention of steam
engine introduced a new source of
power. Railroads were made for steam
engine driven carriages and wagons.

OF

TRANSPORT

Long ago people did not have any means
of transport. They used to move only on
foot and carry goods either on their back
or using animals.
For transport along water routes,
boats were used from ancient times. To
begin with, boats were simple logs of
wood in which a hollow cavity could be
made. Later, people learnt to put
together different pieces of wood and
give shapes to the boats. These shapes

Fig 10.1 Means of transportation

Later came automobiles. Motorised boats
and ships were used as means of transport
on water. The early years of 1900 saw the
development of aeroplanes. These were
later improved to carry passengers and
goods. Electric trains, monorail,
supersonic aeroplanes and spacecraft are
some of the 20th century contributions.
Fig. 10.1 shows some of the different
modes of transport. Place them in the
correct order — from the earliest modes
of transport to the most recent.
Are there any of the early modes of
transport that are not in use today?

On the teacher's suggestion, they
decided to measure the length of the
desk, make a mark exactly in the middle
of it and draw a line to separate the two
halves of the desk.
Both of them are very fond of
playing gilli danda with their friends.
Boojho brought a set of gilli and danda
with him.
Here is how they tried to measure
the length of the desk using the danda
and the gilli (Fig. 10.2).
The desk seems to be having a
length equal to two danda lengths and
two lengths of the gilli. Drawing a line
in the middle of the desk leaves each
of them happy with a half of the desk
equal to a danda and a gilli in length.
After a few days, the marked line gets
wiped out. Boojho now has a new set
of gilli and danda as he lost his old
one. Here is how, the length of the
desk seems to measure using the gilli
and danda (Fig. 10.3).

10.2 HOW FAR HAVE YOU TRAVELLED?
HOW WIDE IS THIS DESK?

How did people know how far they have
travelled?
How will you know whether you can
walk all the way to your school or whether
you will need to take a bus or a rickshaw
to reach your school? When you need to
purchase something, is it possible for you
to walk to the market? How will you know
the answers to these questions?
It is often important to know how far
a place is, so that we can have an idea
how we are going to reach that place —
walk, take a bus or a train, a ship, an
aeroplane or even a spacecraft!
Sometimes, there are objects whose
length or width we need to know.
In Paheli and Boojho's classroom,
there are large desks which are to be
shared by two students. Paheli and
Boojho share one desk, but, frequently
end up fighting that the other is using
a larger share of the desk.

SCIENCE

Hello! Now, when measured with the
new set of gilli and danda, the desk
length seems to be about two danda
lengths, one gilli length with a small
length still left out. This is less than one
gilli length. Now what?
What would you suggest Paheli and
Boojho do, to measure the length of the
whole desk? Can they use a cricket
wicket and bails to measure the length
or do you think that this might create
the similar problem?
One thing they could do is to take a
small length of string and mark two points
on it. This will be a string length. They
can measure the width of the desk in
string lengths (Fig. 10.4). How can they
use the string to measure distances less
than the length of a string? They can fold

before such standard scales were made
and he has been trying to follow different
methods of measuring distances.
There are so many occasions when we
come across a need to measure lengths
and distances. The tailor needs to measure
the length of the cloth to know if it is
enough to stitch a kurta. A carpenter
needs to measure the height and width
of a cupboard to know how much wood
he would need to make its door. The
farmer needs to know the length and
breadth or the area of his land to know
how much seed he can sow and how
much water would be needed for his crops.
Suppose, you are asked how tall you
are? You want to tell the length of a
straight line from the top of your head
to the heel of your feet.
How long is this broom?
How wide is this desk?
How far is it from Delhi to Lucknow?
How far away is the Moon from the
Earth?
All these questions have one thing
in common. They all concern distance
between two places. The two places may
be close enough, like the two ends of a
table or they may be far apart, like
Jammu and Kanyakumari.
Let us do a few measurements to see
what exactly we need to do, when we
measure distances or lengths.

Boojho can measure the exact length of
the desk using the string.

their problem? Yes, Of course!
Boojho has been reading about the
way people used to measure distances

10.3 SOME MEASUREMENTS
Activity 1
Work in groups and each of you do this
activity one by one. Using your foot as a
97

unit of length, measure the length and
breadth of the classroom. It is possible
that while measuring these you may find
some part remains to be measured as it
is smaller than your foot. Use a string
to measure the length of a part of your
foot as you did before. Record your
observations in Table 10.1.

Work in a group and each of you use
your handspan as a unit to measure
the width of a table or a desk in the
classroom (Fig. 10.5).

Fig. 10.5 Measuring the width of a table with a

o
n

handspan

Here too, you may find that you
need string lengths equal to your
handspan and then fractions of
this string length to make the
measurement. Record all observations
in Table 10.2.
We see that, measurement means the
comparison of an unknown quantity
98

Table 10.2 Measuring width of a table

with some known quantity. This known
fixed quantity is called a unit. The result
of a measurement is expressed in two
parts. One part is a number. The other
part is the unit of the measurement. For
example, if in Activity 1, the length of
the room is found to be 12 lengths of
your foot, then 12 is the number and
'foot length' is the unit selected for the
measurement.
Now, study all the measurements
recorded in Table 10.1 and 10.2. Are all
the measurements for the room using
everybody's foot, equal? Are everybody's
measurement, by handspan, of the
width of the table equal? Perhaps the
results could be different as the length
of your handspan and that of your
friends may not be the same. Similarly,
the length of the foot may be slightly
different for all the students. Therefore,
when you tell your measurement using
your handspan or length of foot as a
unit to others, they will not be able to
understand how big the actual length
is, unless they know the length of your
handspan or foot.
We see therefore, that some standard
units of measurement are needed, that
do not change from person to person.
SCIENCE

10.4 STANDARD UNITS
MEASUREMENTS

OF

In ancient times, the length of a foot,
the width of a finger, and the distance
of a step were commonly used as
different units of measurements.
The people of the Indus valley
civilisation must have used very good
measurements of length because we see
evidence in excavations of perfectly
geometrical constructions.
A cubit as the length from the elbow
to the finger tips was used in ancient
Egypt and was also accepted as a unit
of length in other parts of the world.
People also used the "foot" as a unit
of length in different parts of the world.
The length of the foot used varied
slightly from region to region.
People measured a yard of cloth by
the distance between the end of the
outstretched arm and their chin. The
Romans measured with their pace
or steps.
In ancient India, small length
measurements used were an angul
(finger) or a mutthi (fist). Even today, we
can see flower sellers using their forearm
as a unit of length for garlands in many
towns of India. Many such body parts
continue to be in use as unit of length,
when convenient.
However, everyone's body parts could
be of slightly different sizes. This must

have caused confusion in measurement.
In 1790, the French created a standard
unit of measurement called the
metric system.
For the sake of uniformity, scientists
all over the world have accepted a set of
standard units of measurement. The
system of units now used is known as
the International System of Units (SI
units). The SI unit of length is a metre.
A metre scale is shown in Fig.10.6. Also
shown is the 15 cm scale in your
geometry box.
Each metre (m) is divided into 100
equal divisions, called centimetre (cm).
Each centimetre has ten equal divisions,
called millimetre (mm). Thus,
1 m = 100 cm
1 cm = 10 mm
For measuring large distances, metre
is not a convenient unit. We define a
larger unit of length. It is called
kilometre (km).
1 km = 1000 m
Now, we can repeat all our
measurement activities using a
standard scale and measure in SI units.
Before we do that, we do need to know
the correct way of measuring lengths
and distances.

10.5 CORRECT MEASUREMENT
LENGTH

OF

In our daily life we use various types of
measuring devices. We use a metre scale

Fig.10.6 A metre scale and a 15 cm scale
MOTION AND MEASUREMENT OF DISTANCES

99

for measuring length. A tailor uses a
tape, whereas a cloth merchant uses a
metre rod. For measuring the length of
an object, you must choose a suitable
device. You cannot measure the girth of
a tree or the size of your chest using a
metre scale, for instance. Measuring
tape is more suitable for this. For small
measurements, such as the length of
your pencil, you can use a 15 cm scale
from your geometry box.
In taking measurement of a length,
we need to take care of the following:
1. Place the scale in contact with the
object along its length as shown in
Fig.10.7.
2. In some scales, the ends may be
broken. You may not be able to see
the zero mark clearly (Fig.10.8 (a)].
In such cases, you should avoid

taking measurements from the zero
mark of the scale. You can use any
other full mark of the scale, say,
1.0 cm [Fig.10.8 (b)]. Then you must
subtract the reading of this mark
from the reading at the other end.
For example, in Fig.10.8 (b) the
reading at one end is 1.0 cm and
at the other end it is 14.3 cm.
Therefore, the length of the object is
(14.3-1.0) cm = 13.3 cm.

3. Correct position of the eye is also
important for taking measurement.
Your eye must be exactly in front of
the point where the measurement is
to be taken as shown in Fig.10.9.
Position 'B' is the correct position
of the eye. Note that from position
'B', the reading is 7.5 cm. From

measurements are done using a
standard scale. The results may be close
to each other now, but, are they exactly
equal? If not, why do you think there is
a difference? After all, everybody is using
the same scale and not different hand
spans. This could be due to small errors
in taking observations. In higher classes
we will learn about the importance of
knowing and handling such errors in
measurement.

with your handspan and then with a
metre scale. Let all other students
measure this length in a similar way.

10.6 MEASURING THE LENGTH
CURVED LINE

OF A

We cannot measure the length of a
curved line directly by using a metre
scale. We can use a thread to measure
the length of a curved line.

Activity 4

Use a thread to measure the length of
the curved line AB (Fig.10.10). Put a
knot on the thread near one of its ends.
Place this knot on the point A. Now,
place a small portion of the thread along
the line, keeping it taut using your
fingers and thumb. Hold the thread at
this end point with one hand. Using the
other hand, stretch a little more portion
of the thread along the curved line. Go

B

on repeating this process till the other
end B of the curved line is reached.
Make a mark on the thread where it
touches the end B. Now stretch the
thread along a metre scale. Measure the
length between the knot in the beginning
and the final mark on the thread. This
gives the length of the curved line AB.
We see that we need a lot of care to
ensure that we are measuring distances
and lengths correctly. And, we need
some standard units and devices with
which we measure these distances and
can convey our results to others.

How did you decide whether an object
is in motion or at rest?
You might have noticed that the bird
is not at the same place after some time,
while the table is at the same place. On
this basis you may have decided whether
an object is at rest or in motion.
Let us look at the motion of an ant
closely.

recently. List them in Table 10.4. A
school bag, a mosquito, a table, people
sitting on desks, people moving about?
May be a butterfly, dog, cow, your hand,
a small baby, a fish in water, a house, a
factory, a stone, a horse, a ball, a bat, a
moving train, a sewing machine, a wall
clock, hands of a clock? Make your list
as large as you can.
Which of these are moving? Which
are at rest?

Activity 6

Spread a large sheet of white paper on
the ground and keep a little sugar on it.
Ants are likely to be attracted to the
sugar and you will find many ants
crawling on the sheet of paper soon. For
any one ant, try and make a small mark
with a pencil near its position when it
has just crawled on to the sheet of paper
(Fig. 10.11). Keep marking its position
after a few seconds as it moves along on
the sheet of paper. After some time,
shake the paper free of the sugar and
the ants. Connect the different points
you have marked, with arrows, to show
the direction in which the ant was

shows where the ant moved to, in
intervals of a few seconds.
Motion seems to be some kind of a
change in the position of an object
with time, isn't it?
In Activity 5, where did you place
objects like a clock, a sewing machine
or an electric fan in your grouping of
objects? Are these objects moving from
one place to other? No? Do you notice
movement in any of their parts? The
blades of the fan or the hands of a
clock— how are they moving? Is their
movement similar to that of a train? Let
us now look at some types of motion to
help us understand these differences.

10.8 TYPES

In all these examples we see that the
objects move along a straight line. This
type of motion is called rectilinear
motion.

Activity 7
Take a stone, tie a thread to it and whirl
it with your hand. Observe the motion
of the stone. We see that the stone moves
along a circular path.
In this motion, the distance of the
stone from your hand remains the same.
This type of motion is called circular
motion (Fig. 10.13).

MOTION

You may have observed the motion of a
vehicle on a straight road, march-past
of soldiers in a parade or the falling
of a stone (Fig. 10.12). What kind
of motion is this? Sprinters in a
100-metre race
also move along a
straight track. Can
you think of more
such examples from
your surroundings?

Fig. 10.13 Some objects in circular motion

The motion of a point marked on the
blade of an electric fan or the hands of
a clock are examples of circular motion.
The electric fan or the clock by
themselves are not moving from one
place to another. But, the blades of the
103

fan rotate and so do
the hands of a
clock. If we mark a
point anywhere on
the blades of a fan or
on the hands of a
clock, the distance of
this point from the
centre of the fan or
the clock, will remain the same as
they rotate.
In some cases, an object repeats its
motion after some time. This type of
motion is called periodic motion. Take
the stone tied with a string that you
used in Activity 6. Now, hold the string
in your hand and let the stone hang
from it. Pull the stone to one side with
the other hand and let it go. This is a
pendulum. Something to have a lot of
fun with and something that will help
us understand about periodic motion.
Motion of a pendulum, a branch of a
tree moving to and fro, motion of a child
on a swing, strings of a guitar or the
surface of drums (tabla) being played,
are all examples of periodic motion where

an object or a part of it repeats its motion
after a fixed interval of time (Fig. 10.14).
Did you observe a sewing machine
as a part of Activity 5? You must have
observed that it remains at the same
location while its wheel moves with a
circular motion. It also has a needle that
moves up and down continuously, as
long as the wheel rotates, isn't it? This
needle is undergoing a periodic motion.
Have you observed closely, the
motion of a ball on the ground? Here,
SCIENCE

the ball is rolling on the ground –
rotating as well as moving forward on
the ground. Thus, the ball undergoes a
rectilinear motion as well as rotational
motion. Can you think of other
examples where objects undergo
combinations of different types of
motion?
We did many measurement activities
and discussed some kinds of motion.
We saw that motion is a change in the
position of an object with time.

The change in this position can
be determined through distance
measurements. This allows us to know
how fast or slow a motion is. The
movement of a snail on the ground, a
butterfly flitting from flower to flower, a
river flowing along on clear rounded
pebbles, an aeroplane flying high up
in the air — making jet trails, moon
going around the Earth, blood flowing
inside our bodies, there is motion
everywhere around us!

Different modes of transport are used to go from one place to another.

In ancient times, people used length of a foot, the width of a finger, the
distance of a step as units of measurement. This caused confusion and
a need to develop a uniform system of measurement arose.
Now, we use International System of Unit ( SI unit). This is accepted all
over the world.
Metre is the unit of length in SI unit.
