Wastewater Story
Clean water that is fit
for use is unfortunately
not available to all. It
has been reported that
more than one billion of
our fellow human beings
have no access to safe drinking water.
This accounts for a large number of
water-related diseases and even deaths.
Women and girls walk for several
kilometres to collect clean water, as you
read in Chapter 16. Is it not a serious
matter for human dignity?
You have studied in Chapter 16
about the increasing scarcity of freshwater due to population growth,
pollution, industrial development,
mismanagement and other factors.
Realising the urgency of the situation
on the World Water Day, on 22 March
2005, the General Assembly of the
United Nations proclaimed the period
2005 – 2015 as the International Decade
for action on “Water for life”. All efforts
made during this decade aim to reduce
by half the number of people who do
not have access to safe drinking water.
Cleaning of water is a process of
removing pollutants before it enters a
water body or is reused. This process of
wastewater treatment is commonly
known as “Sewage Treatment”. It takes
place in several stages.

All of us use water in our homes and
make it dirty.
Dirty! Are you surprised?
Rich in lather, mixed with oil, black–
brown water that goes down the drains
from sinks, showers, toilets, laundries
is dirty. It is called wastewater. This
used water should not be wasted. We
must clean it up by removing pollutants.
Have you ever thought where the
wastewater goes and what happens to it?

SEWAGE?

Sewage is wastewater released by homes,
industries, hospitals, offices and other
users. It also includes rainwater that has
run down the street during a storm or
heavy rain. The water that washes off
roads and rooftops carries harmful
substances with it. Sewage is a liquid waste.
Most of it is water, which has dissolved
and suspended impurities. These
impurities are called contaminants.

water flowing through it.
Record colour, odour and any other
observation. Discuss with your friends
and your teacher and fill up the

mixture containing suspended solids,
organic and inorganic impurities,

18.3 WATER FRESHENS UP — AN
EVENTFUL JOURNEY

In a home or a public building generally
one set of pipes brings clean water and
another set of pipes takes away
wastewater. Imagine that we could see
through the ground. We would see a
network of big and small pipes, called
sewers, forming the sewerage. It is like
a transport system that carries sewage
from the point of being produced to the
point of disposal, i.e. treatment plant.
Manholes are located at every 50 m
to 60 m in the sewerage, at the junction

Make a line diagram of the sewage
route.
Walk down the street or survey the
campus to find the number of

Use an aerator from an aquarium to
bubble air through the sample in the
glass jar. Allow several hours for
aeration; leave the aerator attached
overnight. If you do not have an
aerator, use a mechanical stirrer or
a mixer. You may have to stir it
several times.
The next day when aeration is
complete, pour another sample into
a second test tube. Label it as “After
aeration; Sample 2”.
Fold a piece of filter paper to form a
cone. Wet the paper with tap water
and then insert the cone in a funnel.
Mount the funnel on a support
(as you have learnt in Class VI).
Place layers of sand, fine gravel and
finally medium gravel in the funnel
(Fig. 18.2). (An actual filtration plant
does not use filter paper, but the sand
filter is several metres deep).
Pour the remaining aerated liquid
through the filter into the beakers.
Do not allow the liquid to spill over
the filter. If the filtered liquid is not
clear, filter it a few times till you get
clear water.
Pour a sample of the filtered water
into a third test tube labelled
“Filtered; Sample 3”.
Pour another sample of the filtered
water into a fourth test tube. Add a
small piece of a chlorine tablet. Mix
well until the water is clear. Label the

3. The water is then allowed to settle in
a large tank which is sloped towards
the middle. Solids like faeces settle
at the bottom and are removed with
a scraper. This is the sludge. A
skimmer removes the floatable solids
like oil and grease. Water so cleared
is called clarified water (Fig. 18.5).

The activated sludge is about 97%
water. The water is removed by sand
drying beds or machines. Dried sludge
is used as manure, returning organic
matter and nutrients to the soil.
The treated water has a very low level
of organic material and suspended
matter. It is discharged into a sea, a river
or into the ground. Nature cleans it up
further. Sometimes it may be necessary
to disinfect water with chemicals like
chlorine and ozone before releasing it
into the distribution system.

The sludge is transferred to a
separate tank where it is decomposed
by the anaerobic bacteria. The biogas
produced in the process can be used as
fuel or can be used to produce electricity.
4. Air is pumped into the clarified water
to help aerobic bacteria to grow.
Bacteria consume human waste,
food waste, soaps and other
unwanted matter still remaining in
clarified water (Fig. 18.6).
After several hours, the suspended
microbes settle at the bottom of the tank
as activated sludge. The water is then
removed from the top.

18.5 BETTER HOUSE KEEPING
PRACTICES

t

One of the ways to minimise or eliminate
waste and pollutants at their source is
to see what you are releasing down the
drain.
Cooking oil and fats should not be
thrown down the drain. They can
harden and block the pipes. In an
open drain the fats clog the soil pores
reducing its effectiveness in filtering
water. Throw oil and fats in the
dustbin.
Chemicals like paints, solvents,
insecticides, motor oil, medicines
may kill microbes that help purify
water. So do not throw them down
the drain.

they relieve themselves?
A very large fraction of our people
defecates in the open, on dry riverbeds,
on railway tracks, near fields and many
a time directly in water. Untreated
human excreta is a health hazard. It
may cause water pollution and soil
pollution. Both the surface water and
groundwater get polluted. Groundwater
is a source of water for wells, tubewells,
springs and many rivers as you learnt
in Chapter 16. Thus, it becomes the
most common route for water borne
diseases. They include cholera, typhoid,
polio, meningitis, hepatitis and
dysentery.

AT

PUBLIC PLACES

In our country fairs are organised
periodically. A large number of people
participate in them. In the same way
railway stations, bus depots, airports,
hospitals ar e very busy places.
Thousands of people visit them daily.
Large amount of waste is generated
here. It must be disposed of properly
otherwise epidemics could break out.
The government has laid down
certain standards of sanitation but,
unfortunately, they are not strictly
enforced.
However, all of us can contribute in
maintaining sanitation at public places.
We should not scatter litter anywhere.
If there is no dustbin in sight, we should
carry the litter home and throw it in the
dustbin.

SCIENCE

We all have a role to play in keeping our
environment clean and healthy. You
must realise your responsibility in
maintaining the water sources in a
healthy state. Adopting good sanitation
practices should be our way of life. As
an agent of change your individual
initiative will make a great difference.

Influence others with your energy, ideas
and optimism. A lot can be done if people
work together. There is great power in
collective action.
Mahatma Gandhi said:
“No one need to wait for anyone else
to adopt a humane and enlightened
course of action.”

What you have learnt

Used water is wastewater. Wastewater could be reused.

Wastewater is generated in homes, industries, agricultural fields and in
other human activities. This is called sewage.
Sewage is a liquid waste which causes water and soil pollution.
Wastewater is treated in a sewage treatment plant.

Treatment plants reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level where nature
can take care of it.

t

Where underground sewerage systems and refuse disposal systems are
not available, the low cost on-site sanitation system can be adopted.
By-products of wastewater treatment are sludge and biogas.
Open drain system is a breeding place for flies, mosquitoes and organisms
which cause diseases.

We should not defecate in the open. It is possible to have safe disposal of
excreta by low cost methods.
