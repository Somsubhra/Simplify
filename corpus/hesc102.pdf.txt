MICROORGANISMS : FRIEND

Y

ou have seen several kinds of
plants and animals. However,
there are other living organisms
around us which we cannot see with
eyes alone. These are called
microorganisms or microbes. For
example, you might have observed that
during rainy season moist bread gets
spoilt and its surface gets covered with
greyish white patches. Observe these
patches through a magnifying glass. You
will see tiny, black rounded structures.
Do you know what these structures are
and where did these come from?

FOE

These observations show that water
and soil are full of tiny organisms,
though not all of them fall into the
category
of
microbes.
These
microorganisms or microbes are so
small in size that they cannot be seen
with the unaided eye. Some of these,
such as the fungus that grows on bread,
can be seen with a magnifying glass.
Others cannot be seen without the help
of a microscope. That is why these are
called microorganisms or microbes.
Microorganisms are classified into
four major groups. These groups are
bacteria, fungi, protozoa and some
algae. Some of these common
microorganisms are shown in
Figs. 2.1 - 2.4.
Viruses are also microscopic. They,
however, reproduce only inside the cells
of the host organism, which may be a
bacterium, plant or animal. Some of the
viruses are shown in Fig. 2.5. Common
ailments like cold, influenza (flu) and
most coughs are caused by viruses.
Serious diseases like polio and chicken
pox are also caused by viruses.
Diseases like dysentery and malaria
are caused by protozoans whereas
typhoid and tuberculosis (TB) are
bacterial diseases.
You have learnt about some of
these microorganisms in Classes VI
and VII.

Friendly Microorganisms
Microorganisms are used for various
purposes. They are used in the
preparation of curd, bread and cake.
Microorganisms have been used for
the production of alcohol since ages.

They are also used in cleaning up
of the environment. For example, the
organic wastes (vegetable peels, remains
of animals, faeces, etc.) are broken
down into harmless and usable
substances by bacteria. Recall that
bacteria are also used in the
preparation of medicines. In agriculture
they are used to increase soil fertility
by fixing nitrogen.

2.2 Where do Microorganisms
Live?

Microorganisms may be single-celled
like bacteria, some algae and protozoa,
or multicellular, such as algae and fungi.
They can survive under all types of
environment, ranging from ice cold
climate to hot springs and deserts to
marshy lands. They are also found
inside the bodies of animals including
humans. Some microorganisms grow on
other organisms while others exist
freely. Microorganisms like amoeba can
live alone, while fungi and bacteria may
live in colonies.

2.3 Microorganisms and Us

Microorganisms play an important role
in our lives. Some of them are beneficial
in many ways whereas some others are
harmful and cause diseases. Let us study
about them in detail.
MICROORGANISMS : FRIEND AND FOE

Making of Curd and Bread
You have learnt in Class VII that milk is
turned into curd by bacteria.

I saw that my mother
added a little curd to warm
milk to set curd for the
next day. I wonder why!

Curd contains several microorganisms. Of these, the bacterium
Lactobacillus promotes the formation
of curd. It multiplies in milk and converts
it into curd. Bacteria are also involved
in the making of cheese, pickles and
many other food items. An important
ingredient of rava (sooji ) idlis and
bhaturas is curd. Can you guess why?

Activity 2.3

find the dough rising?

yeast powder to the sugar solution.
Keep it covered in a warm place for
4-5 hours. Now smell the solution.
Could you get a smell?
This is the smell of alcohol as sugar
has been converted into alcohol by yeast.
This process of conversion of sugar into
alcohol is known as fermentation.

Yeast reproduces rapidly and
produces carbon dioxide during
respiration. Bubbles of the gas fill the
dough and increase its volume (Fig. 2.6).
This is the basis of the use of yeast in
the baking industry for making breads,
pastries and cakes.
Commercial Use of Microorganisms

Microorganisms are used for the large
scale production of alcohol, wine and
acetic acid (vinegar). Yeast is used for
commercial production of alcohol
and wine. For this purpose yeast is
grown on natural sugars present in
grains like barley, wheat, rice and
crushed fruit juices, etc.

Medicinal Use of Microorganisms

Whenever you fall ill the doctor may
give you some antibiotic tablets,
capsules or injections such as of
penicillin. The source of these
medicines is microorganisms. These
medicines kill or stop the growth of the
disease-causing microorganisms.
Such medicines are called antibiotics.
These days a number of antibiotics are
being produced from bacteria and
fungi. Streptomycin, tetracycline and
erythromycin are some of the

In 1929, Alexander
Fleming was working
on a culture of diseasecausing
bacteria.
Suddenly he found the
spores of a little green mould in one of
his culture plates. He observed that
the presence of mould prevented the
growth of bacteria. In fact, it also killed
many of these bacteria. From this the
mould penicillin was prepared.
SCIENCE

commonly known antibiotics which are
made from fungi and bacteria. The
antibiotics are manufactured by
growing specific microorganisms and
are used to cure a variety of diseases.
Antibiotics are even mixed with the
feed of livestock and poultry to check
microbial infection in animals. They are
also used to control many plant
diseases.
It is important to remember that
antibiotics should be taken only on
the advice of a qualified doctor. Also
you must finish the course
prescribed by the doctor. If you take
antibiotics when not needed or in
wrong doses, it may make the drug
less effective when you might need
it in future. Also antibiotics taken
unnecessarily may kill the beneficial
bacteria in the body. Antibiotics,
however, are not effective against
cold and flu as these are caused by
viruses.

we are protected from the diseasecausing microbes. This is how a vaccine
works. Several diseases, including
cholera, tuberculosis, smallpox and
hepatitis can be prevented by
vaccination.

o
n

When a disease-carrying microbe enters
our body, the body produces antibodies
to fight the invader. The body also
remembers how to fight the microbe if
it enters again. So, if dead or weakened
microbes are introduced in a healthy
body, the body fights and kills
them by producing suitable antibodies.
The antibodies remain in the body and

In your childhood, you must have
been given injections to protect yourself
against several diseases. Can you
prepare a list of these diseases? You
may take help from your parents.
It is essential to protect all children
against these diseases. Necessary vaccines
are available in the nearby hospitals. You
might have seen the advertisement on T.V.
and newspapers regarding protection of
children against polio under Pulse Polio
Program. Polio drops given to children are
actually a vaccine.
A worldwide campaign against
smallpox has finally led to its
eradication from most parts of the
world.
These days vaccines are made on a
large scale from microorganisms to
protect humans and other animals from
several diseases.
Increasing Soil Fertility

Some bacteria and blue green algae
(Fig. 2.7) are able to fix nitrogen from
the atmosphere to enrich soil with
nitrogen and increase its fertility. These
microbes are commonly called
biological nitrogen fixers.

Cleaning the Environment

Boojho and Paheli had observed the
school gardener making manure. Along
with their friends, they collected wastes
of plants, vegetables and fruits from
nearby houses and gardens. They put
them in a pit meant for waste disposal.
After some time, it decomposed and got
converted to manure. Boojho and
Paheli wanted to know how this could
happen.

Activity 2.5

Take two pots and fill each pot half
with soil. Mark them A and B. Put
plant waste in pot A and things like
polythene bags, empty glass bottles
and broken plastic toys in pot B.
Put the pots aside. Observe them
after 3-4 weeks.

o
n

Do you find any difference in the
contents of the two pots? If so, what is
the difference? You will find that plant
waste in pot A, has been decomposed.
How could this happen? The plant waste
has been converted into manure by the
action of microbes. The nutrients
22

d
e

h
s

Fig. 2.7 : The Nitrogen fixing blue green algae

released in the process could be used
by the plants again.
Did you notice that in pot B, the
polythene bags, empty glasses, bottles
and broken toy parts did not undergo
any such change? The microbes could
not ‘act’ on them and convert them into
manure.
You often see large amounts of dead
organic matter in the form of decaying
plants and sometimes dead animals on
the ground. You find that they
disappear after some time. This is
because
the
microorganisms
decompose dead organic waste of plants
and animals converting them into
simple substances. These substances
are again used by other plants and
animals. Thus, microorganisms can
be used to degrade the harmful and
smelly substances and thereby clean
up the environment.

2.4 Harmful Microorganisms
Microorganisms are harmful in many
ways. Some of the microorganisms
cause diseases in human beings, plants
and animals. Such disease-causing
SCIENCE

microorganisms are called pathogens.
Some microorganisms spoil food,
clothing and leather. Let us study more
about their harmful activities.
Disease— causing Microorganisms
in Humans
Pathogens enter our body through the
air we breathe, the water we drink or
the food we eat. They can also get
transmitted by direct contact with an
infected person or carried through an
animal. Microbial diseases that can
spread from an infected person to a
healthy person through air, water, food
or physical contact are called
communicable diseases. Examples of
such diseases include cholera, common
cold, chicken pox and tuberculosis.
When a person suffering from
common cold sneezes, fine droplets of
moisture carrying thousands of viruses
are spread in the air. The virus may enter
the body of a healthy person while
breathing.

There are some insects and animals
which act as carriers of diseasecausing microbes. Housefly is one such
carrier. The flies sit on the garbage and
animal excreta. Pathogens stick to their
bodies. When these flies sit on uncovered
food they may transfer the pathogens.
Whoever eats the contaminated food is
likely to get sick. So, it is advisable to
always keep food covered. Avoid
consuming uncovered items of food.
Another example of a carrier is the
female Anopheles mosquito (Fig. 2.8),
which carries the parasite of malaria.
Female Aedes mosquito acts as carrier
of dengue virus. How can we control the
spread of malaria or dengue?

All mosquitoes breed in water. Hence,

etc. By keeping the surroundings clean
and dry we can prevent mosquitoes from
breeding. Try to make a list of measures
which help to avoid the spread of

Food Poisoning

Boojho was invited by his friend to a
party and he ate a variety of foodstuff.
On reaching home he started vomiting.
He had to be taken to a hospital. The
doctor said that this condition could be
due to food poisoning.

o
n

Paheli wonders how
food can become a
‘poison’.

Food poisoning could be due to the
consumption of food spoilt by some
microorganisms. Microorganisms
that grow on our food sometimes
produce toxic substances. These
MICROORGANISMS : FRIEND AND FOE

Insect

d
e

make the food poisonous causing
serious illness and even death. So, it
is very important that we preserve
food to prevent it from being spoilt.

2.5 Food Preservation
In Chapter 1, we have learnt about the
methods used to preserve and store food
grains. How do we preserve cooked food
at home? You know that bread left
unused under moist conditions is
attacked by fungus. Microorganisms
spoil our food. Spoiled food emits bad
smell and has a bad taste and changed
colour. Is spoiling of food a chemical
reaction?
Paheli bought some mangoes but she
could not eat them for a few days. Later
she found that they were spoilt and
rotten. But she knows that the mango
pickle her grandmother makes does not
spoil for a long time. She is confused.
25

Let us study the common methods
to preserve food in our homes. We have
to prevent it from the attack of
microorganisms.

Similarly, we keep our food in the
refrigerator. Low temperature inhibits
the growth of microbes.

Chemical Method
Salts and edible oils are the common
chemicals generally used to check the
growth of microorganisms. Therefore
they are called preservatives. We add
salt or acid preservatives to pickles to
prevent the attack of microbes. Sodium
benzoate and sodium metabisulphite are
common preservatives. These are also
used in the jams and squashes to check
their spoilage.

Why does the milk that
comes in packets not spoil?
My mother told me that the
milk is ‘pasteurized’. What
is pasteurization?

h
s

Pasteurized milk can be consumed
without boiling as it is free from harmful
microbes. The milk is heated to about
700C for 15 to 30 seconds and then
suddenly chilled and stored. By doing
so, it prevents the growth of microbes.
This process was discovered by Louis
Pasteur. It is called pasteurization.

Preservation by Common Salt

Common salt has been used to preserve
meat and fish for ages. Meat and fish
are covered with dry salt to check the
growth of bacteria. Salting is also used
to preserve amla, raw mangoes,
tamarind, etc.
Preservation by Sugar

Jams, jellies and squashes are preserved
by sugar. Sugar reduces the moisture
content which inhibits the growth of
bacteria which spoil food.
Preservation by Oil and Vinegar

o
n

Use of oil and vinegar prevents spoilage
of pickles because bacteria cannot live
in such an environment. Vegetables,
fruits, fish and meat are often preserved
by this method.
Heat and Cold Treatments
You must have observed your mother
boiling milk before it is stored or used.
Boiling kills many microorganisms.
26

d
e

Storage and Packing

These days dry fruits and even
vegetables are sold in sealed air tight
packets to prevent the attack of
microbes.

2.6 Nitrogen Fixation
You have learnt about the bacterium
Rhizobium in Classes VI and VII. It is
involved in the fixation of nitrogen in
leguminous plants (pulses). Recall that
Rhizobium lives in the root nodules of
leguminous plants (Fig. 2.9), such as
beans and peas, with which it has a
symbiotic relationship. Sometimes
nitrogen gets fixed through the action
of lightning. But you know that the
amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere
remains constant. You may wonder
how? Let us understand this in the next
section.
SCIENCE

nitrogen cannot be taken directly by
plants and animals. Certain bacteria and
blue green algae present in the soil fix
nitrogen from the atmosphere and
convert into compounds of nitrogen.
Once nitrogen is converted into these
usable compounds, it can be utilised by
plants from the soil through their root
system. Nitrogen is then used for the
synthesis of plant proteins and other
compounds. Animals feeding on plants
get these proteins and other nitrogen
compounds (Fig. 2.10).
When plants and animals die,
bacteria and fungi present in the soil
convert the nitrogenous wastes into
nitrogenous compounds to be used by
plants again. Certain other bacteria
convert some part of them to nitrogen
gas which goes back into the
atmosphere. As a result, the percentage
of nitrogen in the atmosphere remains
more or less constant.
