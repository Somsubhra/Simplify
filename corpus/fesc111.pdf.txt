Light, Shadows and
Reflections

e see so many objects around
us, colourful and different.
On the way to school we see
things like buses, cars, cycles, trees,
animals and sometimes flowers. How do
you think, we see all these objects?
Think of the same places at night
time if it were completely dark. What will
you see? Suppose you go inside a
completely dark room. Are you able to
see any objects in the room?
But, when you light a candle or a
torch you can see the objects present in
the room, isn’t it? Without light, things
cannot be seen. Light helps us see
objects.
The torch bulb is an object that gives
out light of its own. The Sun, is another
familiar object that gives its own light.
During the day, its light allows us to
see objects. Objects like the sun that
give out or emit light of their own are
called luminous objects.
What about objects like a chair, a
painting or a shoe? We see these when
light from a luminous object (like the
Sun, a torch or an electric light) falls on
these and then travels towards our eye.

all, it is an opaque object. If you are
able to see clearly through an object, it
is allowing light to pass through it and
is transparent. There are some objects
through which we can see, but not very
clearly. Such objects are known as
translucent.

11.1 T RANSPARENT , O PAQUE
TRANSLUCENT OBJECTS

Activity 1

Look around you and collect as many
objects as you can — an eraser, plastic
scale, pen, pencil, notebook, single sheet
of paper, tracing paper or a piece of
cloth. Try to look at something far away,
through each of these objects (Fig. 11.1).
Is light from a far away object able to
travel to your eye, through any of the
objects?
Record your observations in a table
as shown in Table 11.1.
We see that a given object or material
could be transparent, translucent or

opaque depending on whether it allows
light to pass through it completely,
partially or not at all.

11.2 WHAT EXACTLY
Activity 2

ARE

SHADOWS?

Now, one by one hold each of the opaque
objects in the sunlight, slightly above
the ground. What do you see on the
ground? You know that the dark patch
formed by each on the ground is due
to its shadow. Sometimes you can
identify the object by looking at its
shadow (Fig. 11.2).
Spread a sheet of paper on the
ground. Hold a familiar opaque object
at some height, so that its shadow is
formed on the sheet of paper on the
ground. Ask one of your friends to draw

o
n

Fig. 11.2 Sometimes shadow of an object gives
an idea about its shape

the outline of the shadow while you are
holding the object. Draw outlines of the
shadows of other objects in a similar
way.
Now, ask some other friends to
identify the objects from these outlines
of shadows. How many objects are they
able to identify correctly?
Do you observe your shadow in a
dark room or at night when there is no
light? Do you observe a shadow when
there is just a source of light and
nothing else, in a room? It seems we
need a source of light and an opaque
object, to see a shadow. Is there anything
else required?

Activity 3

This is an activity that you will have to
do in the dark. In the evening, go out in
an open ground with a few friends. Take
a torch and a large sheet of cardboard
with you. Hold the torch close to the
ground and shine it upwards so that its
light falls on your friend's face. You now
have a source of light that is falling on
an opaque object. If there were no trees,
building or any other object behind your
friend, would you see the shadow of
your friend's head? This does not mean

a building, or other such surfaces act
as a screen for the shadows you observe
in everyday life.
Shadows give us some information
about shapes of objects. Sometimes,
shadows can also mislead us about the
shape of the object. In Fig. 11.4 are a few
shadows that we can create with our
hands and make-believe that they are
shadows of different animals. Have fun!

that there is no shadow. After all, the
light from the torch is not able to pass
through his body to the other side.
Now, ask another friend to hold the
cardboard sheet behind your friend. Is
the shadow now seen on the cardboard
sheet (Fig. 11.3)?
Thus, the shadow can be seen only
on a screen. The ground, walls of a room,

Activity 4

Place a chair in the school ground on a
sunny day. What do you observe from
the shadow of the chair?
Does the shadow give an accurate
picture of the shape of the chair? If the
chair is turned around a little, how does
the shape of the shadow change?
Take a thin notebook and look at its
shadow. Then, take a rectangular box
and look at its shadow. Do the two
shadows seem to have a similar shape?
Take flowers or other objects of
different colours and look at their
shadows. A red rose and a yellow rose,
for instance. Do the shadows look
different in colour, when the colours of
the objects are different?
Take a long box and look at its
shadow on the ground. When you move
the box around, you may see that the
size of the shadow changes. When is the
shadow of the box the shortest, when
the long side of the box is pointed
towards the Sun or when the short side
is pointing towards the Sun?
Let us use this long box, to prepare
a simple camera.

11.3 A PINHOLE CAMERA
Surely we need a lot of complicated stuff
to make a camera? Not really. If we just
wish to make a simple pin hole camera.

Activity 5
Take two boxes so that one can slide
into another with no gap in between
them. Cut open one side of each box.
On the opposite face of the larger box,
make a small hole in the middle
[Fig. 11.5 (a)]. In the smaller box, cut
out from the middle a square with a side
of about 5 to 6 cm. Cover this open
square in the box with tracing paper
(translucent screen) [Fig. 11.5 (b)]. Slide
the smaller box inside the larger one
with the hole, in such a way that the
side with the tracing paper is inside
[Fig. 11.5 (c)]. Your pin hole camera is
ready for use.
Holding the pin hole camera look
through the open face of the smaller
box. You should use a piece of black
cloth to cover your head and the pinhole
camera. Now, try to look at some distant
objects like a tree or a building through
the pinhole camera. Make sure that the
objects you wish to look at through your

pinhole camera are in bright sun shine.
Move the smaller box forward or
backward till you get a picture on the
tracing paper pasted at the other end.
Are these pin hole images different
from their shadows?
Look through your pin hole camera
at the vehicles and people moving on
the road in bright sun light.
Do the pictures seen in the camera
show the colours of the objects on the
other side? Are the images erect or
upside down? Surprise, surprise!
Let us now image the Sun, with our
pin hole camera. We need a slightly
different set up for this. We just need a
large sheet of cardboard with a small
pin hole in the middle. Hold the sheet
up in the Sun and let its shadow fall on
a clear area. Do you see a small circular
image of the Sun in the middle of the
shadow of the cardboard sheet?
Look at these pin hole images of the
Sun when an eclipse is visible from your
location. Adjust your pin hole and
screen to get a clear image before the
eclipse is to occur. Look at the image as

the eclipse begins. You will notice a part
of the Sun's image gradually becoming
darker as the eclipse starts. Never ever
look directly at the Sun. That could
be extremely harmful for the eyes.
There is an interesting pin hole
camera in Nature. Sometimes, when we
pass under a tree covered with large
number of leaves, we notice small
patches of sun light under it (Fig. 11.6).
These circular images are, in fact, pin
hole images of the Sun. The gaps
between the leaves, act as the pin holes.
These gaps are all kinds of irregular
shapes, but, we can see circular images
of the Sun. Try to locate images of the

Paheli has another thought. Surely,
all these results that we are seeing,
formation of shadows and pinhole
images are possible only if light moves
in a straight path?

Activity 6
Let us use a piece of a pipe or a long
rubber tube. Light a candle and fix it
on a table at one end of the room. Now
standing at the other end of the room
look at the candle through the pipe

Sun when an eclipse occurs next. That

Boojho has this thought. We saw
upside down images of people on the
road, with our pinhole camera. What
about the images of the Sun? Did we
notice them to be upside down or
anything like that?
LIGHT, SHADOWS AND REFLECTIONS

[Fig. 11.7 (a)]. Is the candle visible? Bend
the pipe a little while you are looking at
the candle [Fig. 11.7 (b)]. Is the candle
visible now? Turn the pipe a little to your
right or left. Can you see the candle now?
What do you conclude from this?
This suggests that light travels along
a straight line, isn’t it? That is why,
when opaque objects obstruct it, a
shadow forms.

11.4 MIRRORS

REFLECTIONS

We all use mirrors at home. You look into
the mirror and see your own face inside
the mirror. What you see is a reflection
of your face in the mirror. We also see
reflections of other objects that are in
front of the mirror. Sometimes, we see
reflections of trees, buildings and other
objects in the water of a pond or a lake.

adjust the direction of the torch so that
the patch of light falls on another friend
standing in the room.
This activity suggests that a mirror
changes the direction of light that falls
on it.
Here is an activity that shows light
travelling along straight lines and
getting reflected from a mirror.

This activity should be done at night or
in a dark room. Ask one of your friends
to hold a mirror in his/her hand at one
corner of the room. Stand at another
corner with a torch in your hand. Cover
the glass of torch with your fingers and
switch it on. Adjust your fingers with a
small gap between them so that you can
get a beam of light. Direct the beam of
the torch light onto the mirror that your
friend is holding. Do you see a patch of
light on the other side (Fig. 11.8)? Now,

Fix a comb on one side of a large thermo
Col sheet and fix a mirror on the other
side as shown in Fig. 11.9. Spread a
dark coloured sheet of paper between
the mirror and the comb. Keep this in
sunlight or send a beam of light from a
torch through the comb.
What do you observe? Do you get
a pattern similar to that shown
in Fig. 11.9?
This activity gives us an idea of the
manner in which light travels and gets
reflected from a mirror.

Opaque objects do not allow light to pass through them.

Transparent objects allow light to pass through them and we can see
through these objects clearly.
Translucent objects allow light to pass through them partially.

Shadows are formed when an opaque object comes in the path of light.

Pinhole camera can be made with simple materials and can be used to
image the Sun and brightly lit objects.
Mirror reflection gives us clear images.

Images are very different from shadows.
Light travels in straight line.

SUGGESTED ACTIVITIES
1.

Make a row of your friends — A, B, C and D, standing in a line. Let one friend
stand in front facing them and holding out a mirror towards them (Fig. 11.10).
Now, each person can tell who they are able to see in the Mirror. A,B, C, or D.

If, A is able to see B in the mirror then, can B also see A in the mirror? Similarly,
for any two pairs amongst A,B,C, or D?
If A is not able to see B in the mirror, then, is B able to see A in the mirror?
Similarly, for any two pairs amongst A,B,C, or D?

This activity tells us something about the way light travels and gets reflected
from mirrors. You will learn more about this in higher classes.

Daayan-Baayan—Take a comb in your right hand and bring it up to your hair
and look at yourself in the mirror. There is your familiar face, grinning at you ☺
Wait, try and find out which is the hand holding the comb, in your mirror
reflection. Is it the right hand or the left? You were holding it in your right hand,
isn't it?
While a pin hole camera seems to be giving us upside down images, a mirror
seems to be turning right hand into left hand and the left into right hand. We
will learn more about this in the higher classes.

THINGS TO THINK ABOUT
1.

Opaque objects cast shadows, isn't it? Now, if we hold a transparent object in
the Sun, do we see anything on the ground that gives us a hint that we are
holding something in our hand?

2.

We saw that changing colour of opaque objects does not change the colour of
their shadows. What happens if we place an opaque object in coloured light?
You can cover the face of a torch with a coloured transparent paper to do this.
(Did you ever noticed the colours of evening shadows just as the Sun is setting?)

THINGS TO READ

Rudyard Kipling's "Just So Stories" and in particular, the story of "How the Leopard
got its spots" where he mentions stripy, speckly, patchy-blatchy shadows. Here
are a few lines from this story, that has a lot of shadows.

...after ever so many days, they saw a great, high, tall forest full of tree trunks
all 'sclusively speckled and sprottled and spottled, dotted and splashed and
slashed and hatched and cross-hatched with shadows. (Say that quickly aloud,
and you will see how very shadowy the forest must have been.)
'What is this,' said the Leopard, 'that is so 'sclusively dark, and yet so full of
little pieces of light?'
