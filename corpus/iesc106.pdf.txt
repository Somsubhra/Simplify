There are noticeable differences between
the two. Plants are stationary or fixed – they
don’t move. Most of the tissues they have are
supportive, which provides them with
structural strength. Most of these tissues are
dead, since dead cells can provide mechanical
strength as easily as live ones, and need less
maintenance.
Animals on the other hand move around
in search of food, mates and shelter. They
consume more energy as compared to plants.
Most of the tissues they contain are living.
Another difference between animals and
plants is in the pattern of growth. The growth
in plants is limited to certain regions, while
this is not so in animals. There are some
tissues in plants that divide throughout their
life. These tissues are localised in certain
regions. Based on the dividing capacity of the
tissues, various plant tissues can be classified
as growing or meristematic tissue and
permanent tissue. Cell growth in animals is
more uniform. So, there is no such
demarcation of dividing and non-dividing
regions in animals.
The structural organisation of organs and
organ systems is far more specialised and
localised in complex animals than even in very
complex plants. This fundamental difference
reflects the different modes of life pursued
by these two major groups of organisms,
particularly in their different feeding methods.
Also, they are differently adapted for a
sedentary existence on one hand (plants) and
active locomotion on the other (animals),
contributing to this difference in organ system
design.
It is with reference to these complex
animal and plant bodies that we will now talk
about the concept of tissues in some detail.

From the last chapter, we recall that all living
organisms are made of cells. In unicellular
organisms, a single cell performs all basic
functions. For example, in Amoeba, a single
cell carries out movement, intake of food and
respiratory gases, respiration and excretion.
But in multi-cellular organisms there are
millions of cells. Most of these cells are
specialised to carry out a few functions. Each
specialised function is taken up by a different
group of cells. Since these cells carry out only
a particular function, they do it very
efficiently. In human beings, muscle cells
contract and relax to cause movement, nerve
cells carry messages, blood flows to transport
oxygen, food, hormones and waste material
and so on. In plants, vascular tissues conduct
food and water from one part of the plant to
other parts. So, multi-cellular organisms
show division of labour. Cells specialising in
one function are often grouped together in
the body. This means that a particular
function is carried out by a cluster of cells at
a definite place in the body. This cluster of
cells, called a tissue, is arranged and designed
so as to give the highest possible efficiency of
function. Blood, phloem and muscle are all
examples of tissues.
A group of cells that are similar in
structure and/or work together to achieve a
particular function forms a tissue.

of Same Types of Tissues?
Let us compare their structure and functions.
Do plants and animals have the same

6.2 Plant Tissues

The growth of plants occurs only in certain
specific regions. This is because the dividing
tissue, also known as meristematic tissue, is
located only at these points. Depending on
the region where they are present,
meristematic tissues are classified as apical,
lateral and intercalary (Fig. 6.2). New cells
produced by meristem are initially like those
of meristem itself, but as they grow and
mature, their characteristics slowly change
and they become differentiated as
components of other tissues.

Apical meristem is present at the growing
tips of stems and roots and increases the
length of the stem and the root. The girth of
the stem or root increases due to lateral
meristem (cambium). Intercalary meristem is
the meristem at the base of the leaves or
internodes (on either side of the node)
on twigs.

As the cells of this tissue are very active,
they have dense cytoplasm, thin cellulose
walls and prominent nuclei. They lack
vacuoles. Can we think why they would lack
vacuoles? (You might want to refer to the
functions of vacuoles in the chapter on cells.)

What happens to the cells formed by
meristematic tissue? They take up a specific
role and lose the ability to divide. As a result,
they form a permanent tissue. This process
of taking up a permanent shape, size, and a
function is called differentiation. Cells of
meristematic tissue differentiate to form
different types of permanent tissue.

so that large spaces between cells
(intercellular spaces) are found in this tissue
[Fig. 6.4 a(i)]. This tissue provides support to
plants and also stores food. In some
situations, it contains chlorophyll and
performs photosynthesis, and then it is called
chlorenchyma. In aquatic plants, large air
cavities are present in parenchyma to give
buoyancy to the plants to help them float.
Such a parenchyma type is called
aerenchyma. The parenchyma of stems and
roots also stores nutrients and water.
SCIENCE

The flexibility in plants is due to another
permanent tissue, collenchyma. It allows
easy bending in various parts of a plant (leaf,
stem) without breaking. It also provides
mechanical support to plants. We can find

this tissue in leaf stalks below the epidermis.
The cells of this tissue are living, elongated
and irregularly thickened at the
corners. There is very little intercellular
space (Fig. 6.4 b).

epidermis may be thicker since protection
against water loss is critical. The entire
surface of a plant has this outer covering of
epidermis. It protects all the parts of the plant.
Epidermal cells on the aerial parts of the plant
often secrete a waxy, water-resistant layer on
their outer surface. This aids in protection
against loss of water, mechanical injury and
invasion by parasitic fungi. Since it has a
protective role to play, cells of epidermal
tissue form a continuous layer without
intercellular spaces. Most epidermal cells are
relatively flat. Often their outer and side walls
are thicker than the inner wall.
We can observe small pores here and there
in the epidermis of the leaf. These pores are
called stomata (Fig. 6.5). Stomata are
enclosed by two kidney-shaped cells called
guard cells. They are necessary for
exchanging gases with the atmosphere.
Transpiration (loss of water in the form of
water vapour) also takes place through
stomata.

bl

Yet another type of permanent tissue is
sclerenchyma. It is the tissue which makes
the plant hard and stiff. We have seen the
husk of a coconut. It is made of
sclerenchymatous tissue. The cells of this
tissue are dead. They are long and narrow as
the walls are thickened due to lignin (a
chemical substance which acts as cement and
hardens them). Often these walls are so thick
that there is no internal space inside the cell
(Fig. 6.4 c). This tissue is present in stems,
around vascular bundles, in the veins of
leaves and in the hard covering of seeds and
nuts. It provides strength to the plant parts.

Think about which gas may be required

Find out the role of transpiration in plants.

Epidermal cells of the roots, whose
function is water absorption, commonly bear
long hair-like parts that greatly increase the
total absorptive surface area.
In some plants like desert plants,
epidermis has a thick waxy coating of cutin
(chemical substance with waterproof quality)
on its outer surface. Can we think of a reason
for this?
Is the outer layer of a branch of a tree
different from the outer layer of a young stem?
As plants grow older, the outer protective
tissue undergoes certain changes. A strip of
secondary meristem replaces the epidermis
of the stem. Cells on the outside are cut off
from this layer. This forms the several-layer
thick cork or the bark of the tree. Cells of
cork are dead and compactly arranged
without intercellular spaces (Fig. 6.6). They
also have a chemical called suberin in their
walls that makes them impervious to gases
and water.

The different types of tissues we have
discussed until now are all made of one type
of cells, which look like each other. Such
tissues are called simple permanent tissue.
Yet another type of permanent tissue is
complex tissue. Complex tissues are made of
more than one type of cells. All these cells
coordinate to perform a common function.
Xylem and phloem are examples of such
complex tissues. They are both conducting
tissues and constitute a vascular bundle.
Vascular or conductive tissue is a distinctive
feature of the complex plants, one that has
made possible their survival in the terrestrial
environment. In Fig. 6.3 showing a section of
stem, can you see different types of cells in
the vascular bundle?
Xylem consists of tracheids, vessels,
xylem parenchyma (Fig. 6.7 a,b,c) and xylem
fibres. The cells have thick walls, and many
of them are dead cells. Tracheids and vessels
are tubular structures. This allows them to
transport water and minerals vertically. The
parenchyma stores food and helps in the
sideways conduction of water. Fibres are
mainly supportive in function.
Phloem is made up of four types of
elements: sieve tubes, companion cells,
phloem fibres and the phloem parenchyma
[Fig. 6.7 (d)]. Sieve tubes are tubular cells with
perforated walls. Phloem is unlike xylem in
that materials can move in both directions in
it. Phloem transports food from leaves to other

During breathing we inhale oxygen. Where
does this oxygen go? It is absorbed in the
lungs and then is transported to all the body
cells through blood. Why would cells need
oxygen? The functions of mitochondria we
studied earlier provide a clue to this question.
Blood flows and carries various substances
from one part of the body to the other. For
example, it carries oxygen and food to all cells.
It also collects wastes from all parts of the
body and carries them to the liver and kidney
for disposal.
Blood and muscles are both examples of
tissues found in our body. On the basis of
the functions they perform we can think of
different types of animal tissues, such as
epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscular
tissue and nervous tissue. Blood is a type of
connective tissue, and muscle forms
muscular tissue.

The covering or protective tissues in the
animal body are epithelial tissues. Epithelium
covers most organs and cavities within the
body. It also forms a barrier to keep different
body systems separate. The skin, the lining
of the mouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung
alveoli and kidney tubules are all made of
epithelial tissue. Epithelial tissue cells are
tightly packed and form a continuous sheet.
They have only a small amount of cementing
material between them and almost no
intercellular spaces. Obviously, anything
entering or leaving the body must cross at
least one layer of epithelium. As a result, the
permeability of the cells of various epithelia
play an important role in regulating the
exchange of materials between the body and
the external environment and also between
different parts of the body. Regardless of the
type, all epithelium is usually separated from
the underlying tissue by an extracellular
fibrous basement membrane.
Different epithelia (Fig. 6.9) show differing
structures that correlate with their unique
functions. For example, in cells lining blood
vessels or lung alveoli, where transportation
of substances occurs through a selectively

squamous epithelium. Simple squamous
epithelial cells are extremely thin and flat and
form a delicate lining. The oesophagus and
the lining of the mouth are also covered with
squamous epithelium. The skin, which
protects the body, is also made of squamous
epithelium. Skin epithelial cells are arranged
in many layers to prevent wear and tear. Since
they are arranged in a pattern of layers, the
epithelium is called stratified squamous
epithelium.
Where absorption and secretion occur, as
in the inner lining of the intestine, tall
epithelial cells are present. This columnar
(meaning ‘pillar-like’) epithelium facilitates
movement across the epithelial barrier. In the
respiratory tract, the columnar epithelial
tissue also has cilia, which are hair-like
projections on the outer surfaces of epithelial
cells. These cilia can move, and their
movement pushes the mucus forward to clear
it. This type of epithelium is thus ciliated
columnar epithelium.
Cuboidal epithelium (with cube-shaped
cells) forms the lining of kidney tubules and
ducts of salivary glands, where it provides
mechanical support. Epithelial cells often
acquire additional specialisation as gland
cells, which can secrete substances at the
epithelial surface. Sometimes a portion of the
epithelial tissue folds inward, and a
multicellular gland is formed. This is
glandular epithelium.

Blood is a type of connective tissue. Why
would it be called ‘connective’ tissue? A clue
is provided in the introduction of this chapter!
Now, let us look at this type of tissue in some
more detail. The cells of connective tissue are
loosely spaced and embedded in an
intercellular matrix (Fig. 6.10). The matrix
may be jelly like, fluid, dense or rigid. The
nature of matrix differs in concordance with
the function of the particular connective
tissue.

different cells present in it under a microscope.

Blood has a fluid (liquid) matrix called
plasma, in which red blood cells (RBCs), white
blood cells (WBCs) and platelets are
suspended. The plasma contains proteins,
salts and hormones. Blood flows and
transports gases, digested food, hormones
and waste materials to different parts of the
body.
Bone is another example of a connective
tissue. It forms the framework that supports
the body. It also anchors the muscles and
supports the main organs of the body. It is a
strong and nonflexible tissue (what would be
the advantage of these properties for bone
functions?). Bone cells are embedded in a
hard matrix that is composed of calcium and
phosphorus compounds.
Two bones can be connected to each other
by another type of connective tissue called
the ligament. This tissue is very elastic. It has
considerable strength. Ligaments contain
very little matrix. Tendons connect muscles
to bones and are another type of connective
tissue. Tendons are fibrous tissue with great
strength but limited flexibility.
Another type of connective tissue,
cartilage, has widely spaced cells. The solid
matrix is composed of proteins and sugars.
Cartilage smoothens bone surfaces at joints
and is also present in the nose, ear, trachea
and larynx. We can fold the cartilage of the
ears, but we cannot bend the bones in our
arms. Think of how the two tissues are
different!
Areolar connective tissue is found between
the skin and muscles, around blood vessels
and nerves and in the bone marrow. It fills
the space inside the organs, supports internal
organs and helps in repair of tissues.
Where are fats stored in our body? Fatstoring adipose tissue is found below the skin
and between internal organs. The cells of this
tissue are filled with fat globules. Storage of
fats also lets it act as an insulator.

the microscope, these muscles show alternate
light and dark bands or striations when
stained appropriately. As a result, they are
also called striated muscles. The cells of this
tissue are long, cylindrical, unbranched and
multinucleate (having many nuclei).
The movement of food in the alimentary
canal or the contraction and relaxation of
blood vessels are involuntary movements. We
cannot really start them or stop them simply
by wanting to do so! Smooth muscles [Fig.
6.11(b)] or involuntary muscles control such
movements. They are also found in the iris of
the eye, in ureters and in the bronchi of the
lungs. The cells are long with pointed ends
(spindle-shaped) and uninucleate (having a
single nucleus). They are also called
unstriated muscles – why would they be
called that?
The muscles of the heart show rhythmic
contraction and relaxation throughout life.
These involuntary muscles are called cardiac
muscles [Fig. 6.11(c)]. Heart muscle cells are
cylindrical, branched and uninucleate.
Compare the structures of different types
of muscular tissues. Note their shape,

TISSUES

All cells possess the ability to respond to
stimuli. However, cells of the nervous tissue
are highly specialised for being stimulated
and then transmitting the stimulus very
rapidly from one place to another within the
body. The brain, spinal cord and nerves are
all composed of the nervous tissue. The cells
of this tissue are called nerve cells or neurons.
A neuron consists of a cell body with a
nucleus and cytoplasm, from which long thin
hair-like parts arise (Fig. 6.12). Usually each
neuron has a single long part, called the axon,
and many short, branched parts called
dendrites. An individual nerve cell may be up
to a metre long. Many nerve fibres bound
together by connective tissue make up
a nerve.
