oil is one of the most important
natural resources. It supports the
growth of plants by holding the
roots firmly and supplying water and
nutrients. It is the home for many
organisms. Soil is essential for
agriculture. Agriculture provides food,
clothing and shelter for all. Soil is thus
an inseparable part of our life. The
earthy fragrance of soil after the first rain
is always refreshing.

answer the following questions:

Polythene bags and plastics pollute
the soil. They also kill the organisms
living in the soil. That is why there is
a demand to ban the polythene bags
and plastics. Other substances which
pollute the soil are a number of waste
products, chemicals and pesticides.
Waste products and chemicals should
be treated before they are released
into the soil. The use of pesticides
should be minimised.

Soil is composed of distinct layers.

how these layers are arranged.

SOIL

Do you see layers of particles of
different sizes in the glass tumbler?
 Draw a diagram showing these layers.
 Are there some dead rotting leaves
or animal remains floating on water?
The rotting dead matter in the soil is
called humus.
You probably know that the soil is
formed by the breaking down of rocks
by the action of wind, water and climate.
This process is called weathering. The
nature of any soil depends upon the
rocks from which it has been formed and
the type of vegetation that grows in it.
A vertical section through different
layers of the soil is called the soil profile.
Each layer differs in feel (texture),

We usually see the top surface of
the soil, not the layers below it. If we
look at the sides of a recently dug ditch,
we can see the inner layers of the soil,
too. Such a view enables us to observe
the soil profile at that place. Soil profile
can also be seen while digging a well or
laying the foundation of a building. It
can also be seen at the sides of a road
on a hill or at a steep river bank.
The uppermost horizon is generally
dark in colour as it is rich in humus
and minerals. The humus makes the

This provides shelter for many living
organisms such as worms, rodents,
moles and beetles. The roots of small
plants are embedded entirely in the
topsoil.
The next layer has a lesser amount
of humus but more of minerals. This
layer is generally harder and more
compact and is called the B-horizon or
the middle layer.
The third layer is the C-horizon,
which is made up of small lumps of
rocks with cracks and crevices. Below

As you know, weathering of rocks
produces small particles of various
materials. These include sand and clay.
The relative amount of sand and clay
depends upon the rock from which the
particles were formed, that is the parent
rock. The mixture of rock particles
and humus is called the soil. Living
organisms, such as bacteria, plant roots
and earthworm are also important parts
of any soil.
The soil is classified on the basis of
the proportion of particles of various
sizes. If soil contains greater proportion
of big particles it is called sandy soil.
If the proportion of fine particles is
relatively higher, then it is called
clayey soil. If the amount of large and
fine particles is about the same, then
the soil is called loamy. Thus, the soil
can be classified as sandy, clayey and
loamy.
The sizes of the particles in a soil
have a very important influence on its
properties. Sand particles are quite
large. They cannot fit closely together,
so there are large spaces between them.
These spaces are filled with air. We say
that the sand is well aerated. Water can
drain quickly through the spaces
between the sand particles. So, sandy
soils tend to be light, well aerated and
rather dry. Clay particles, being much
smaller, pack tightly together, leaving
little space for air. Unlike sandy soil,

water can be held in the tiny gaps
between the particles of clay. So clay
soils have little air. But they are heavy
as they hold more water than the sandy
soils.
The best topsoil for growing plants
is loam. Loamy soil is a mixture of sand,
clay and another type of soil particle
known as silt. Silt occurs as a deposit
in river beds. The size of the silt particles
is between those of sand and clay. The
loamy soil also has humus in it. It has
the right water holding capacity for the
growth of plants.

this layer is the bedrock, which is hard
and difficult to dig with a spade.

I want to know:
What kind of soil should be

Activity 9.3

Collect samples of clayey, loamy and
sandy soils. Take a fistful of soil from
one of the samples. Remove any pebbles,
rocks or grass blades from it. Now add
water drop by drop and knead the soil
[Fig. 9.4 (a)]. Add just enough water so
that a ball [Fig. 9.4 (b)] can be made from
it, but at the same time it should not be
sticky. Try to make a ball [Fig. 9.4 (c)]
from this soil. On a flat surface, roll this
ball into a cylinder [Fig. 9.4 (d)]. Try to
make a ring from this cylinder [Fig. 9.4 (e)].
Repeat this activity with other samples
also. Does the extent to which a soil can
be shaped indicate its type?

cut off its bottom.
2. If PVC pipe (approx. diameter 5 cm)
is available, cut it into 20 cm long
pieces and use them.
At the place where you collect the soil,
place the pipe about 2 cm deep in the
ground. Pour 200 mL water in the pipe
slowly. For measuring 200 mL water you

Boojho and Paheli marked two different

two bottles of the same size with water.
They emptied the water from the bottles,
one each, at the same time in the two
squares. They observed that the water
on the floor flowed down and was not
absorbed. On the kutcha road, on the
other hand, the water was absorbed.

When all the water has percolated
leaving the pipe empty, note the time

your soil sample. Compare your findings
with others and arrange the soil samples
in the increasing order of the rate of
percolation.

On heating, water in the soil
evaporates, moves up and condenses on
the cooler inner walls of the upper part
of the boiling tube.

Pour water all over the soil. Keep pouring
water till it starts dripping. Subtract the
amount of water left in the measuring
cylinder from the amount you started
with. This is the amount of water
retained by the soil. Record your results
in your notebook in the following
manner:
Weight of soil = 50g
Initial volume of water in the
measuring cylinder = U mL
Final volume of water in the
measuring cylinder = V mL
Volume of water absorbed by the soil
= (U – V) mL
Weight of water absorbed by the soil
= (U – V) g
(1 mL of water has weight equal to 1 g)

9.7 SOIL

AND

CROPS

Different types of soils are found in
different parts of India. In some parts
there is clayey soil, in some parts there
is loamy soil while in some other parts
there is sandy soil.
Soil is affected by wind, rainfall,
temperature, light and humidity. These
are some important climatic factors
which affect the soil profile and bring
changes in the soil structure. The

Gram (g) and kilogram (kg) are actually units of mass. A mass of 1 gram weighs 1 gram weight,
and a mass of 1 kilogram weighs 1 kilogram weight. However, in daily life, and in commerce and
industry, the distinction between gram and gram weight is generally omitted.

John, Rashida and Radha went to Leeladhar Dada and Sontosh Malviya of
Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh. Leeladhar Dada was preparing the soil to make
items like surahi, matki, kalla (earthen frying pan) etc. The following is the
conversation they all had with Leeladhar Dada:
–
Where was the soil obtained from?
Dada–We brought the black soil from a piece of barren land.
–
How is the soil prepared?
Dada–Dry soil will be placed in a large tank and would be cleaned of pebbles etc.
After removing these things the soil will be soaked for around 8 hours.
This soil would be kneaded after mixing horse dung. The kneaded soil
would be placed on the wheel and given appropriate shape. The final shape
is given with hands. The items are coloured after three days of drying. All
the items are baked at high temperature after drying in the air.
–
Why is the horse dung mixed in soil?
Dada–Burnt horse dung helps open up the pores in the soil. So that water could
percolate out of the matkas and surahis, evaporate and cools the water
inside. You know Sohagpuri surahis and matkas are famous in far off
places like Jabalpur, Nagpur, Allahabad, etc.

Soil erosion

The removal of land surface by water,
wind or ice is known as erosion. Plant
roots firmly bind the soil. In the
absence of plants, soil becomes loose.
So it can be moved by wind and flowing
water. Erosion of soil is more severe
in areas of little or no sur face
vegetation, such as desert or bare
lands. So, cutting of trees and
deforestation should be prevented and
effort should be made to increase the
green areas.
