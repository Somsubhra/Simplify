o outside and observe all the
plants around you. Do you see
that some plants are small,
some very big, while some are just
patches of green on the soil?
Some have green leaves,
while some others have
reddish ones. Some have
huge red flowers, some have
tiny blue ones, while some
have none. We do see a
variety of plants existing all
around us — near our
homes, in the school
ground, on the way to the
school, in the parks and
gardens, isn’t it?
Let us get to know the different
parts of any plant. This will help us
understand the differences between

plants of different kinds. Can you label
the stem, branches, roots, leaves, and
flowers of the plant shown in Fig.7.1?
Colour the parts of the plant.

Look closely at the stem and branches
of:
1. Plants much smaller than you.
2. Plants that are about your size, and
3. Plants which are much taller than
you.
Feel their stem and try to bend them
gently to see if they are tender or hard.

observed, in Table 7.1. Some examples
are shown. You can fill the Columns 1,
Suggestion: Work in groups of 4-5
students in doing activities suggested
in this Chapter so that a minimum
number of plants are uprooted.
Use weeds with soft stems for the
activities. Do you know what weeds

often some unwanted plants or
weeds start growing. Have you seen

Plants with green and tender stems
are called herbs. They are usually short
and may not have many branches
[Fig.7.3 (a)].
Some plants have the stem
branching out near the base. The stem
is hard but not very thick. Such plants
are called shrubs [Fig .7.3(b)].
Some plants are very tall and have
hard and thick brown stem. The stems
have branches in the upper part, much
above the ground. Such plants are
called trees [Fig.7.3(c)].

Perhaps there are some plants in
your school or at home that you take
care of. Write down the names of any
two trees, shrubs, herbs or creepers
growing in your house or school.

money plant, beanstalk, gourd plants and
grape vines have. Do observe some of these
plants. How are these different from a herb,
a shrub or a tree? Why do you think
some of them need support to climb
upwards?

Plants with weak
stems that cannot stand
upright and spread on
the ground are called
creepers, while those
that take support on
neighbouring structures

Fig.7.5. Observe it the next day.
Do any of the parts of the herb appear
to have red colour? If yes, how do you
think the colour reached there?
You can cut the stem across and
look for the red colour inside the stem
( Fig. 7.6) .
From this activity we see that water
moves up the stem. In other words, stem
conducts water. Just like the red ink,
minerals dissolved in water also move
up in the stem, along with the water.

The water and minerals go to leaves and

through narrow tubes inside the stem.
Paheli did this activity with herbs
having white flowers. She put one
branch with a white flower in the water
in glass A and added a few drops of red
ink to the water. She did a funny thing
with another branch. She split it half
way along its length and put the two

Look at leaves of plants around you and
draw them in your notebook. Are all the
leaves the same in size, shape and
colour?
How are they attached to the stem?
The part of a leaf by which it is attached
to the stem is called petiole. The broad,
green part of the leaf is called lamina
(Fig. 7.8). Can you identify these parts
of the leaves in plants around you? Do
all the leaves have petioles?

She wants you to guess what would

When you had cut across the stem
in Activity 2, did you notice a number
of spots of red colour arranged in a ring
inside the stem? Does this explain the
results that Paheli obtained? Try this
activity yourself!
GETTING TO KNOW PLANTS

Put a leaf under a white sheet of paper
or a sheet in your notebook. Hold it in
place as shown in Fig. 7.9. Hold your
pencil tip sideways and rub it on the
portion of the paper having the leaf below
it. Did you get an
impression with
some lines in it?
Are they similar to
those on the leaf?
These lines on
the leaf are called
veins. Do you see

Fig. 7.10 Leaf venation (a) reticulate and

middle of the leaf? This vein is called the
midrib. The design made by veins in a
leaf is called the leaf venation. If this
design is net-like on both sides of
midrib, the venation is reticulate
[Fig. 7.10 (a)]. In the leaves of grass you
might have seen that the veins are parallel
to one another. This is parallel venation
[(Fig. 7.10 (b)]. Observe the venation in
as many leaves as you can without
removing them from the plant. Draw the
pattern and write names of some plants
having reticulate and parallel venation.
Shall we now find out some of the
functions of a leaf?

We will require a herb, two transparent
polythene bags and some string.
Do this activity during day time on a
sunny day. Use a healthy, well watered
plant that has been growing in the sun,
for this activity. Enclose a leafy branch
of the plant in a polythene bag and tie
up its mouth as shown in Fig. 7.11. Tie
up the mouth of the empty polythene
bag and keep it also in the sun.
After a few hours, observe the inner
surface of the bags. What do you see?

o
n

56

Are there any droplets of water in any
of the bags? Which bag has the droplets?
How do you think they got there? [Don’t
forget to remove the polythene bag after
the activity!]
Water comes out of leaves in the form
of vapour by a process called
transpiration. Plants release a lot of water
into the air through this process. We will
learn more about this in Chapter 14.
Why did we tie a bag around the
leaves? Would we have seen the water
from the transpiration of plants
otherwise? What makes the water
appear on the polythene bag? In
Chapter 5, we noticed water changing
into different forms in some of our
activities. Can you think of these and
name the process that makes water
drops appear on the polythene bag?
Leaves also have another function.
Let us study this.

Activity 5
We would require a leaf, spirit, a beaker,
test tube, burner, water, a plate and
iodine solution for this activity.
Put a leaf in a test tube and pour
spirit to completely cover the leaf. Now,

put the test tube in a beaker half filled
with water. Heat the beaker till all the

into the spirit in the test tube. Take out
the leaf carefully and wash it in water.
Put it on a plate and pour some iodine
solution over it (Fig. 7.12).

ultimately gets stored in different parts
of plant as starch.
How do we know that the leaf has
prepared the starch and not received it
from another part of the plant? To test
this, the above activity can be repeated
with a little difference.
Place a potted plant with green
leaves, in a dark room for a day or two.
Now, cover a portion of a leaf of the plant
completely with black paper and leave
the plant in the Sun for a day. Remove
the leaf covered in black paper and
repeat the test for starch.
What do you see? Which part of the
leaf shows the presence of starch? Does
this help us understand that leaves
produce starch in the presence
of sunlight?
We see that the stem supplies leaf
with water. The leaf uses the water to
make food. The leaves also lose water
through transpiration.How do the stem
and leaves get the water? That is where
the roots come in!

Note: Since the activity involves the
use of spirit and heating, it is advised
that it is demonstrated by the teacher
in the class.

What do you observe? Compare your
observations with those done in
Chapter 2, when you tested food for
presence of different nutrients. Does this
mean that the leaf has starch in it?
In Chapter 2, we saw that a slice of
raw potato also shows the presence of
starch. Potatoes get this starch from
other parts of the plant and store it.
However, leaves prepared their food in
the presence of sunlight and a green
coloured substance present in them. For
this, they use water and carbon dioxide
from air. This process is called
photosynthesis. Oxygen is given out in
this process. The food prepared by leaves

watering their plant correctly, Paheli or
Boojho? Why?

Which part of the plant is in the soil?
Let us learn more about this part from
the following activities.

Activity 6
You would require two pots, some soil,
khurpi (for digging), blade or a pair of
scissors and water. This activity is to be
done in groups of 4-5 students.
Select two weeds of the same kind
from an open ground and dig them out.
Take care that their roots do not break.
Plant one of the weeds in the soil in pot
A [Fig. 7.14 (a)]. Cut off the roots from
the other weed and plant it in the soil
in pot B [Fig. 7.14 (b)]. Water them
regularly. Observe the plants after a
week. Are both plants healthy?

Activity 7
We would require seeds of gram and
maize, cotton wool, katori and some
water.
Take two katoris. Place some wet
cotton wool in them. Put 3 or 4 seeds
of gram in one and maize in the other.
Keep the cotton wet by sprinkling
water every day, until the sprouts have
grown into young plants. After a week
try to separate the young plants from
the cotton wool (Fig. 7.15).

Let us do an activity to study another
function of root.
58

Was it easy to separate the cotton wool
from the roots? Why?
In Activity 6, we could not easily pull
out the plants from the soil, right? We
dug them out. The roots help in holding
the plant firmly in the soil. They are said
to anchor the plant to the soil.
You have seen that there are different
kinds of stems and leaves. Do the roots
also show a variety? Let us find out.

Activity 8
Study Fig. 7.16 (a) and (b) carefully.
Now, look at the roots of the gram plants
you have pulled out from the cotton
wool. Do they look like the roots shown
in Fig. 7.16 (a) or those in Fig. 7.16 (b)?

How about the roots of the maize plant?
Write ‘gram’ or ‘maize’ in the blank
spaces in the figure after matching the
roots with the figures.
In what way are the roots of gram
and maize similar? In what way are they
different? There seem to be two different
types of roots, isn’t it? Are there also
other types of roots? Let us find out.

For roots of the kind shown in
Fig.7.17 (a), the main root is called tap
root and the smaller roots are called
lateral roots. Plants with roots as shown
in Fig. 7.17 (b) do not have any main
root. All roots seem similar and these
are called fibrous roots.
Separate the weeds you have collected
into (a) those that have tap roots and
(b) those that have fibrous roots. Look
at the leaves of the plants in Group (a).
What kind of venation do they have?
What kind of venation do you see for
plants of Group (b)?
Do you notice that leaf venation and
the type of roots in a plant are related
in a very interesting way? In Table 7.2,
can you match the type of leaf venation
and the type of roots for some plants
you have studied in all the activities
so far?

roots

We have learnt that roots absorb
water and minerals from the soil and
the stem conducts these to leaves and
59

other parts of the plant. The leaves
prepare food. This food travels through
the stem and is stored in different parts
of a plant. We eat some of these as roots—
like carrot, radish, sweet potato, turnip
and tapioca. We also eat many other
parts of a plant where the food is stored.
Do you agree that stem is like a two
way street? Write down what goes up
the stem and what comes down,
in Fig. 7.18.

Which colour did you use for the
flower in Fig. 7.1? Are all flowers
colourful? Have you ever seen flowers
on the plants of grass, wheat, maize,
mango or guava? If you see any flowers
in these plants, are they brightly
coloured?

table, from a field trip to a locality where
there are plants with flowers. Fill the
last two columns after you have gone
through the entire section.
To see the inner parts of the flower
clearly, you have to cut it open, if its
petals are joined. For example, in datura
and other bell shape flowers, the petals
have to be cut lengthwise and spread
out so that the inner parts can be seen
clearly (Fig. 7.21).

On your field trip, try to find out the
names of as many of the flowers as you
can by asking the gardener or any other
person. Remember, not to pluck more
flowers than you need. Based on what
you have filled in Table 7.3, answer the
following questions.
Do all flowers have sepals, petals,
stamens and pistils? Are there flowers that
do not have any of these? Are there flowers
which have parts other than these?
Did you find any flowers which have
sepals and petals that look similar?
Did you find any flowers in which
the number of sepals is different from
the number of petals?

Do you now agree that the structure
of the flower is not always the same?
The number of sepals, petals, stamens
and pistils may also be different in
different flowers. Sometimes, some of
these parts may even be absent!

We have studied some features and

We studied the structure of different
