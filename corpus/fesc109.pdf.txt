The Living Organisms and
Their Surroundings

aheli and Boojho went on
vacation to many places of
interest. One such trip took
them to the river Ganga in Rishikesh.
They climbed the mountains of the
Himalayas, where it was very cold. They
saw many kinds of trees on these
mountains — oaks, pines and deodars,
very different from the ones near their
home on the plains! In yet another trip,
they travelled to Rajasthan and moved
on camels through the hot desert. They
collected different kinds of cactus plants
from this trip. Finally, they went on a
trip to Puri and visited the sea beach,
dotted with casuarina trees. While
recollecting all the fun that they had on
these trips, a thought struck them. All
these places were so different from one
another, some were cold, some very hot
and dry, and some places so humid. And
yet all of them had many organisms
(living creatures) of various kinds.
They tried to think of a place on Earth
where there may not be any living
creatures. Boojho thought of places near
his home. Inside the house, he tried the
cupboards. He had thought that there
may not be any living organisms here,
but he found one tiny spider in the
cupboard. Outside the home too, there
did not seem to be any place, he could
think of, that did not have living creatures

of some kind or the other (Fig. 9.1). Paheli
started thinking and reading about far
away places. She read that people have
even found tiny living organisms in the
openings of volcanoes!

9.1 ORGANISMS AND THE
SURROUNDINGS WHERE THEY LIVE

Another thought that occurred to Paheli
and Boojho was about the kinds of living
organisms that were present in different
locations that they had visited. The
deserts had camels, the mountains had
goats and yak. Puri had some other
creatures — crabs on the beach and
such a variety of fish being caught by
the fishermen at the sea! And then,
there did seem to be some creatures like
ants that were present in all these
different locations. The kinds of plants
found in each of these regions were so
different from the plants of the other
regions. What about the surroundings

in these different regions? Were they
the same?

will discuss the table as we travel
through many more interesting places.

Activity 1

9.2 HABITAT AND ADAPTATION

Let us start with a forest. Think of all
the plants, animals and objects that can
be found there. List them in Column 1
of Table 9.1. List things, animals and
plants, found in the other regions that
are also shown in the table. You can
collect the examples scattered through
this chapter to fill Table 9.1. Discuss
also with your friends, parents and
teachers, to find more examples to fill
the tables. You can also consult many
interesting books in libraries that talk
of animals, plants and minerals of
different regions.
T ry and include many plants,
animals and objects, big and small, in
each of the columns in this table. What
kind of objects will we find that may not
be animals or plants? Perhaps parts of
plants like dried leaves, or parts of
animals, like bones. We may also find
different kinds of soils and pebbles.
Water in the oceans may have salts
dissolved in it as discussed in Chapter
5. There could be many more objects.
As we go through the chapter, keep
adding more examples to Table 9.1. We

What do you find from the plants and
animals listed in Activity 1? Did you find
a large variety in them? Look at what you
have entered in the column for the desert
and the column for the sea in Table 9.1.
Did you list very different kind of
organisms in these two columns?
What are the surroundings like, in
these two regions?
In the sea, plants and animals are
surrounded by saline (salty) water. Most
of them use the air dissolved in water.
There is very little water available in
the desert. It is very hot in the day time
and very cold at night in the desert. The
animals and plants of the desert live on
the desert soil and breathe air from the
surroundings.
The sea and the desert are very
different surroundings and we find very
different kind of plants and animals in
these two regions, isn’t it? Let us look
at two very different kinds of organisms
from the desert and the sea – a camel
and a fish. The body structure of a camel
helps it to survive in desert conditions.
Camels have long legs which help to

keep their bodies away from the heat of
the sand (Fig. 9.2). They excrete small
amount of urine, their dung is dry and
they do not sweat. Since camels lose
very little water from their bodies, they
can live for many days without water.
Let us look at different kinds of fish.
Some of these are shown in Fig. 9.3.
There are so many kinds of fish, but, do
you see that they all have something
common about their shape? All the ones
shown here have the streamlined shape
that was discussed in Chapter 8. This
shape helps them move inside water.
Fish have slippery scales on their bodies.
These scales protect the fish and also
help in easy movement through water.
We discussed in Chapter 8, that fish
have flat fins and tails that help them
to change directions and keep their body
balance in water. Gills present in the
fish help them to use oxygen dissolved
in water.
We see that the features of a fish help
it to live inside water and the features of
a camel help it to survive in a desert.

We have taken only two examples
from a very wide variety of animals and
plants that live on the Earth. In all this
variety of organisms, we will find that
they have certain features that help
them live in the surroundings in which
they are normally found. The presence
of specific features or certain habits,
which enable a plant or an animal to
live in its surroundings, is called
adaptation. Different animals are
adapted to their surroundings in
different ways.
The surroundings where organisms
live is called a habitat. The organisms
depend for their food, water, air, shelter
and other needs on their habitat.
Habitat means a dwelling place (a
home). Several kinds of plants and
animals may share the same habitat.
The plants and animals that live on
land are said to live in terrestrial
habitats. Some examples of terrestrial
habitats are forests, grasslands, deserts,
coastal and mountain regions. On the
other hand, the habitats of plants and

There are some changes that can happen in an organism over a short period
of time to help them adjust to some changes in their surroundings. For instance,
if we live in the plains and suddenly go to high mountain regions, we may
experience difficulty in breathing and doing physical exercise for some days.
We need to breathe faster when we are on high mountains. After some days,
our body adjusts to the changed conditions on the high mountain. Such
small changes that take place in the body of a single organism over short
periods, to overcome small problems due to changes in the surroundings, are
called acclimatisation. These changes are different from the adaptations that
take place over thousands of years.

animals that live in water are called
aquatic habitats. Ponds, swamps,
lakes, rivers and oceans are some
examples of aquatic habitats. There are
large variations in forests, grasslands,
deserts, coastal and mountain regions
located in different parts of the world.
This is true for all aquatic habitats
as well.
The living things such as plants
and animals, in a habitat, are its biotic
components. Various non-living things
such as rocks, soil, air and water in
the habitat constitute its abiotic
components. Sunlight and heat
also form abiotic components of
the habitat.
We know that some plants grow from
seeds. Let us look at some abiotic factors
and their effect on seeds as they grow
into young plants.

o
n

Activity 2

Recall Activity 5 in Chapter 1 — we made
sprouts from moong and chana seeds.
When the seed turned into a sprout, it
germinated. This was the beginning of
a new plant, from the seed.
82

Collect some dry moong seeds. Keep
a small heap of seeds aside and soak
the rest in water for a day. Divide the
soaked seeds into four parts. Keep one
part completely submerged in water for
3-4 days. Do not disturb the dry seeds
and those submerged in water. Keep one
part of soaked seeds in a sunny room
and another in a completely dark
region like a cupboard that does not
allow any light to come in. Keep the last
part in very cold surroundings, say, in
a refrigerator or with ice around them.
Set these three parts to germinate by
rinsing them and draining the water
every day. What do you notice, after a
few days? Do the seeds in all the five
parts germinate equally? Do you find
slower or no germination in any
of these?
Do you find that abiotic factors like
air, water, light and heat are very
important for growth of plants. In fact,
these abiotic factors are important for
all living organisms.
We find that organisms exist in very
cold as well as very hot climates and
surroundings, isn’t it? How do they
SCIENCE

manage to survive? That is where,
adaptation comes in.
Adaptation does not take place in a
short time. Over thousands of years, the
abiotic factors of a region change. Those
animals which cannot adapt to these
changes die out, and only the adapted
ones survive. Animals adapt to different
abiotic factors in different ways. The
result is variety of organisms present in
different habitats.
Let us look at some habitats, the
abiotic factors of these, and the
adaptations of animals to these habitats.

9.3 A JOURNEY THROUGH DIFFERENT
HABITATS
Some Terrestrial Habitats

Deserts
We discussed the abiotic factors of a
desert and the adaptations in camels
to these. What about other animals
and plants that are found in deserts?
Do they have the same kind of
adaptations?
There are desert animals like rats
and snakes, which do not have the long
legs that the camel has. To stay away
from the intense heat during the day,
they stay in burrows deep in the sand
(Fig 9.4). These animals come out only
during the night, when it is cooler.
Fig. 9.5 shows some typical plants
that grow in a desert. How are these
adapted to the desert?

some parts of the two plants, as was
done for Activity 4 in Chapter 7, where
we studied transpiration in plants.
Leave the potted plants in the sun and
observe after a few hours. What do you
see? Do you notice any difference in the
amount of water collected on the two
polythene bags?
Desert plants lose very little water
through transpiration. The leaves in
desert plants are either absent, very
small, or they are present in the shape
of spines. This helps in reducing loss of
water from the leaves through
transpiration. The leaf-like structure
you see in a cactus is, in fact, its stem
(Fig. 9.5). Photosynthesis in these plants
83

is usually carried out by the stems. The
stem is also covered with a thick waxy
layer, which helps to retain water. Most
desert plants have roots that go very
deep into the soil for absorbing water.
Mountain regions
These habitats are normally very cold
and windy. In some areas, snowfall may
take place in winters.
There is a large variety of plants and
animals living in the mountain regions.
Have you seen the kind of trees shown
in Fig. 9.6?

also present on mountains. They may
have different kind of adaptations to
survive on the mountains.
Animals living in the mountain regions
are also adapted to the conditions there
(Fig. 9.7). They have thick skin or fur to
protect them from cold. For example, yaks
have long hair to keep them warm. Snow
leopard has thick fur on its body

Fig. 9.6 Trees of a mountain habitat

If you live in a mountain region or
have visited one, you may have seen a
large number of such trees. But, have
you ever noticed such trees naturally
growing in other regions?
How are these trees adapted to the
conditions prevailing in their habitat?
These trees are normally cone shaped
and have sloping branches. The leaves
of some of these trees are needle-like.
This helps the rainwater and snow to
slide off easily. There could be trees with
shapes very different from these that are

feet from the cold when it walks on the
snow. The mountain goat has strong
hooves for running up the rocky slopes
of the mountains.

regions, the surroundings change and

survive? It’s light brown colour helps it
to hide in dry grasslands when it hunts
for prey (animals to eat). The eyes in
front of the face allow it to have a correct
idea about the location of its prey.
A deer is another animal that lives in
forests and grasslands. It has strong teeth
for chewing hard plant stems of the
forest. A deer needs to know about the
presence of predators ( animals like lion
that make it their prey ) in order to run
away from them and not become their
prey. It has long ears to hear movements
of predators. The eyes on the side of its
head allow it to look in all directions for
danger. The speed of the deer helps them
to run away from the predators.
There are many other features of a
lion, a deer or other animals and plants
that help them to survive in their
habitat.

Grasslands

A lion lives in a forest or a grassland
and is a strong animal that can hunt
and kill animals like deer. It is light
brown in colour. Look at the picture of
a lion and that of a deer (Fig. 9.8). How
are the eyes placed in the face for these
two animals? Are they in the front or
on the side of the face? Lions have long
claws in their front legs that can be
withdrawn inside the toes. Do the
features of a lion help it in any way to

THE LIVING ORGANISMS AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS

Oceans
We already discussed how fish are
adapted to live in the sea. Many other
sea animals have streamlined bodies to
help them move easily in water. There
are some sea animals like squids and
octopus, which do not have this
streamlined shape. They stay deeper in
the ocean, near the seabed and catch
any prey that moves towards them.
However, when they move in water they
make their body shapes streamlined.
These animals have gills to help them
use oxygen dissolved in water.
There are some sea animals like
dolphins and whales that do not have
85

gills. They breathe in air through
nostrils or blowholes that are located
on the upper parts of their heads. This
allows them to breathe in air when they
swim near the surface of water. They can
stay inside the water for a long time
without breathing. They come out to the
surface from time to time, to breathe in
air. Did you ever see this interesting
activity of dolphins in television
programme or films on ocean life?

absorption of nutrients and water from
the soil. However, in aquatic plants, roots
are much reduced in size and their main
function is to hold the plant in place.
The stems of these plants are long,
hollow and light. The stems grow up to
the surface of water while the leaves and
flowers, float on the surface of the water.
Some aquatic plants are totally
submerged in water. All parts of such
plants grow under water. Some of these
plants have narrow and thin ribbon-like
leaves. These can bend in the flowing
water. In some submerged plants, leaves
are often highly divided, through which
the water can easily flow without
damaging them.
Frogs usually have ponds as their
habitat. Frogs can stay both inside the
pond water as well as move on land.
They have strong back legs that help
them in leaping and catching their prey.
They have webbed feet which help them
swim in water.
We have discussed only a few
common animals and plants compared
to the wide variety that live in the
different habitats. You may have also
noticed the very wide variety in plants
around you, when you prepared a
herbarium as part of the suggested
activities in Chapter 7. Imagine the kind
of variety that you could see in a
herbarium of leaves of plants from all
regions of the Earth!

and try to draw the kinds of plants that
are seen there. How are the leaves, stems

Some of these plants have their roots

9.4 LIVING THINGS AROUND

US

We went on a journey through different
habitats and discussed many plants and
SCIENCE

animals. In Activity 1, we listed objects,
plants and animals found in different
surroundings. Suppose we stop a while
and think which examples in our list
are living? Let us think of examples from
a forest. Trees, creepers, small and big
animals, birds, snakes, insects, rocks,
soil, water, air, dry leaves, dead animals,
mushrooms and moss may be only some
of the objects that are present in the
forest. Which of these are living?
Think of objects that you can see
around you at this moment and group
them as living and non-living. In some
cases, it is easy for us to know. For
example, objects like chair or a table in
our homes we know that they are not
alive. Paheli was reading this rhyme
from Complete Nonsense written by
Edward Lear:

Paheli and Boojho found the poem
so very funny, because they knew that
a chair or a table is not alive and it
cannot talk, walk or suffer from the
usual problems that all of us face.
A chair, table, stone or a coin. We
know that they are not alive. Similarly,
we do know that we are alive and so are
all the people of the world. We also see
animals around us that are so full of
life — dogs, cats, monkeys, squirrels,
insects and many others.
How do we know that something is
living? Often, it is not so easy to decide.
We are told that plants are living things,
but they do not appear to move like a
dog or a pigeon. On the other hand, a
car or a bus can move, still we consider
them as non-living. Plants and animals
appear to grow in size with time. But
then, at times, clouds in the sky also
seem to grow in size. Does it mean that
clouds are living? No! So, how does one
distinguish between living and nonliving things? Do living things have
some common characteristics that
make them very different from the
non-living?
You are a wonderful example of a living
being. What characteristics do you have
which make you different from a nonliving thing? List a few of these
characteristics in your notebook. Look at
your list and mark those characteristics
that you have listed, which may also be
found in animals or plants.
Some of these characteristics are
perhaps common to all living things.

Do all living things need food?
In Chapters 1 and 2, we learnt that all
living things need food and how
essential it is to animals and to us. We
have also learnt that plants make their
own food through the process of
photosynthesis. Animals depend on
plants and other animals for their food.
Food gives organisms the energy
needed for them to grow. Organisms also
need this energy for other life processes
that go on inside them.

pups of a dog grow
into adults. A
chicken hatched
from an egg, grows
into a hen or a cock.
(Fig 9.11).
Plants also grow.
Look around you
and see a few plants
of a particular type.
Some are very small
and young, some Fig. 9.11 A chicken
are grown. They grows into an adult
may all be in different stages of growth.
Look at the plants after a few days and
weeks. You may find that some of them
have grown in size. Growth seems to be
common to all living things.
Do you think, non-living things
cannot show growth?

Do all living things show
growth?

Does the kurta you had four years back,
still fit you? You cannot wear it any
more, isn’t it? You must have grown
taller during these years. You may not
realise it, but you are growing all the
time and in few more years you will
become an adult. (Fig 9.10).
Young ones of animals also grow into
adults. You would surely have noticed

o
n

88

Do all living things respire?

Can we live without breathing? When
we inhale, the air moves from outside to
the inside of the body. When we breathe
out, the air moves from inside our body
to outside. Breathing is part of a process
called respiration. In respiration, some
of the oxygen of the air we breathe in, is
used by the living body. We breathe
out the carbon dioxide produced in this
process.
The process of breathing in animals
like cows, buffaloes, dogs or cats is
similar to humans. Observe any one of
these animals while they are taking rest,
and notice the movement of their
abdomen. This slow movement indicates
that they are breathing.
SCIENCE

Respiration is necessary for all living
organisms. It is through respiration that
the body finally obtains energy from the
food it takes.
Some animals may have different
mechanisms for the exchange of gases,
which is a part of the respiration process.
For example, earthworms breathe
through their skin. Fish, we have learnt,
have gills for using oxygen dissolved in
water. The gills absorb oxygen from the
air dissolved in water.
Do plants also respire? Exchange of
gases in plants mainly takes place
through their leaves. The leaves take in
air through tiny pores in them and use
the oxygen. They give out carbon
dioxide to the air.
We learnt that in sunlight, plants
use carbon dioxide of air to produce
their own food and give out oxygen.
Plants produce their food only during
the daytime whereas respiration in
them takes place day and night. The
amount of oxygen released in the
process of food preparation by plants
is much more than the oxygen they use
in respiration.

they adjust to the changed bright
surroundings. Your favourite food,
bright light and a thorn, in the above
situations are some examples of changes
in your surroundings. All of us respond
immediately to such changes. Changes
in our surroundings that makes us
respond to them, are called stimuli.
Do other animals also respond to
stimuli? Observe the behaviour of
animals, when the food is served to
them. Do you find them suddenly
becoming active on seeing the food?
When you move towards a bird, what
does it do? Wild animals run away when
bright light is flashed towards them.
Similarly, cockroaches begin to move to
their hiding places if the light in the
kitchen is switched on at night. Can you
give some more examples of responses
of animals to stimuli?
Do plants also respond to stimuli?
Flowers of some plants bloom only at
night. In some plants flowers close after
sunset. In some plants like mimosa,
commonly known as ‘touch-me-not’,
leaves close or fold when someone
touches them. These are some examples
of responses of plants towards changes
in their surroundings.

All living things respond to changes
around them.

Living organisms and excretion

All living things take food. Not all the
food that is eaten is really used, only a
part of it is utilised by the body. What
happens to the rest? This has to be
removed by the body as wastes. Our body
also produces some wastes in other life
processes. The process of getting rid of
these wastes by the living organisms is
known as excretion.
Do plants also excrete? Yes, they do.
However, the mechanisms in plants are a
little different. Some harmful or poisonous
materials do get produced in plants as
wastes. Some plants find it possible to
store the waste products within their
parts in a way that they do not harm the
plant as a whole. Some plants remove
waste products as secretions.
Excretion is another characteristics
common to all living things.

Animals reproduce their own kind.
The mode of reproduction may be
different, in different animals. Some
animals produce their young ones
through eggs. Some animals give birth
to the young ones (Fig. 9.14).
Plants also reproduce. Like animals,
plants also differ in their mode of
reproduction. Many plants reproduce
through seeds. Plants produce seeds,

own kind through reproduction. It
takes place in many different ways, for
different organisms.

Do all living things move?

which can germinate and grow into new
plants (Fig.9.15).
Some plants also reproduce through
parts other than seeds. For example, a
part of a potato with a bud, grows into a
new plant (Fig 9.16).

Plants also reproduce through
cuttings. Would you like to grow a plant
in this way yourself?

Activity 5

In Chapter 8, we discussed the various
ways in which animals move. They move
from one place to another and also show
other body movements.
What about plants? Do they also
move? Plants are generally anchored in
soil so they do not move from one place
to another. However, various substances
like water, minerals and the food
synthesised by them moves from one
part of the plant to other. Have you
noticed any other kind of movement in
plants? Opening or closing of flowers?
Do you recall how some plants show
movement in response to certain
stimuli?
We also have some non-living
things moving, of course. A bus, car, a
small piece of paper, clouds and so on.
Is there something different in these
movements from the movements of
living beings?
There is such a variety of living
organisms, but, all of them show some
common characteristics, as we have
discussed. Yet another common
characteristic is that living beings die.
Because organisms die, organism types
can survive over thousands of years only
if they reproduce their own kind. One
single organism may die without ever
reproducing, but, the type of organism
can exist only if there is reproduction.

Take a cutting from a rose or a menhdi
plant. Fix it in the soil and water it
regularly. What do you observe, after a
few days?
It may not be easy to grow plants from
cuttings. Do not be disappointed if your
cutting does not grow. Talk to a gardner,
if possible, on the care to be given to
cuttings to make them grow into plants.
THE LIVING ORGANISMS AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS

91

We see that, all living things seem to
have some common characteristics.
They all need food, respire, respond to
stimuli, reproduce, show movement,
grow and die.
Do we find some non-living things that
also show some of these characteristics?
Cars, bicycle, clocks and the water in
the river move. The moon moves in the
sky. A cloud grows in size right in front
of our eyes. Can such things be called
living? We ask ourselves, do these objects
also show all the other characteristics
of living things?
In general, something that is living
may have all the characteristics that we
have discussed, while non-living things
may not show all these characteristics
at the same time.
Is this always true? Do we always find
that living things definitely show all the
characteristics of the living that we have
discussed? Do we always find that nonliving things may show only some of these
characteristics and never all of them?
To understand this a little better, let
us look at a specific example. Consider
any seed, say, moong. Is it living? It can

stay in a shop for months and not show
any growth or some of the other
characteristics of life. However, we bring
the same seed and plant it in soil, water
it and it turns into a whole plant. Did
the seed — need food, did it excrete,
grow or reproduce when it was in the
shop for many months?
We see that there can be cases when
we cannot easily say that a thing has all
the characteristics that we have discussed,
for it to be called living.

“What then is life?”

Push your hand deep inside a sack of
wheat. Do you find it is warm inside?
There is some heat being produced
inside the sack of wheat. The seeds
respire and in that process give out
some heat.
We see that respiration is a process
that takes place in seeds even when
some of the other life processes may not
be very active.
It may not be very easy to answer
our question — “what then is life”?
However, looking at all the diversity of
living beings around us, we can
conclude that “life is beautiful”!

SCIENCE



The surroundings where plants and animals live, is called their habitat.



Several kinds of plants and animals may share the same habitat.



The presence of specific features and habits, which enable a plant or an
animal to live in a particular habitat, is called adaptation.



There are many types of habitats, however, these may be broadly grouped
as terrestrial (on the land) and aquatic (in water).



There is a wide variety of organisms present in different habitats.



Plants, animals and microorganisms together constitute biotic
components.



Rocks, soil, air, water, light and temperature are some of the abiotic
components of our surroundings.



Living things have certain common characteristics — they need food,
they respire and, excrete, respond to their environment, reproduce, grow
and show movement.

SUGGESTED PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
1.

Many magazines and newspapers talk about possibility of life outside the
Earth. Read these articles and have a discussion in the class about what
could be defined as life outside Earth.

2.

Visit a local zoo and find out what special arrangements are made for the
animals that have been brought there from different habitats.

3.

Find out where are the habitats of the polar bear and the penguin. For each
animal, explain two ways in which it is well adapted to its habitat.

4.

Find out which animals live in the foot-hills of the Himalayas. Find out if the
types and varieties of animals and plants changes as one goes higher into
the mountain regions of the Himalayas.

5.

Make a habitat album. Try to obtain pictures of animals and plants that you
have listed in Activity 1 and paste these under different habitat sections in
the album. Draw the leaf shapes and structures for trees found in these
different regions and include these in the album. In addition, draw the
patterns of branching found in trees of these different regions and include
these also in the album.
