Water: A Precious Resource

“Jal Hai, To Kal Hai”
teachers must very often be advising you
not to waste water. No wonder we
celebrate water day every year to attract
the attention of everybody towards the
importance of conserving water.
The amount of water recommended
by the United Nations for drinking,
washing, cooking and maintaining proper
hygiene is a minimum of 50 litres per
person per day. This amount is about
two and a half buckets of water per
person per day. Is your family getting at
least this much of water? If yes, you
should consider yourself fortunate
because millions of people in our
country do not get enough water. What
about your friends and their families?
Share your experience with them.
In some places there is an acute
shortage of water. Taps running dry,
long queues for water (Fig. 16.2), fights,
marches and protests for demand of
water have become a common sight,
especially during summers. Some of the
newspaper clippings shown in Fig. 16.3
clearly indicate this message. Is it not
true that we face acute shortage of
water?

Year 2003 was observed as
the International Year of
Freshwater to make people
aware of this dwindling natural resource.
more than one third of the people in
the world could face water scarcity.
Before we discuss why water is
getting scarce we must know how much
water is available for use on our planet.

16.1 HOW

MUCH

WATER

IS

AVAILABLE

Look at the picture of the earth taken
from space. Why does it appear blue?
Surely, you can guess!
You are aware that about 71% of
the earth’s surface is covered with
water. Almost all the water on the
earth is contained in the seas and
oceans, rivers, lakes, ice caps, as
groundwater and in the atmosphere.
However, most of this water is not fit for
human consumption. The water that is
fit for use is freshwater. Perform the
SCIENCE

the relative amount of water available
in some of these sources.

Are you afraid that continuous use will
some day exhaust all the water available
for use? You know that water on the
earth has been maintained for millions
of years by various processes which
make the water cycle. You have studied
the water cycle in Class VI. Write in your
own words what you know about the
water cycle.
You know that when water circulates
through the water cycle it can be found
in all the three forms, i.e., solid, liquid
and gas — at any given time somewhere
on the earth. The solid form, snow and
ice, is present as ice caps at the poles of

the earth, snow-covered mountains and
glaciers. Liquid water is present in
oceans, lakes, rivers, and even
underground. The gaseous form is the
water vapour present in the air around
us. The continuous cycling of water
among its three forms keeps the total
amount of water on the earth constant
even when the whole world is using it.
Does it give you any relief?
Can you recall the processes involved

bodies. The water is drawn from
nearby lakes, rivers, ponds or
wells. The water is supplied
through a network of pipes.
Many villages do not have such
a water supply system. There
people fetch water directly from
the sources. Often women and
children have to walk several
kilometres to fetch water
(Fig. 16.6). The children suffer
a lot. They cannot attend
school regularly since they
spend hours in fetching water.

Fig. 16.6 Women fetching water

Women have to
perform a number of
household chores. If they have
also to spend time to fetch water
it adds to their burden.

A large number of people draw water
from wells, tube wells or hand pumps.
From where do these sources get water?

16.3 GROUNDWATER AS AN IMPORTANT
SOURCE OF WATER

no

tt

If we dig a hole in the ground near a
water body we may find that the soil is
moist. The moisture in the soil indicates
the presence of water underground. If
we dig deeper and deeper, we would
reach a level where all the space between
particles of soil and gaps between rocks
are filled with water (Fig. 16.7). The
upper limit of this layer is called the
water table. The water table varies from
WATER: A PRECIOUS RESOURCE

place to place, and it may even change
at a given place. The water table may be
at a depth of less than a metre or may
be several metres below the ground. The
water found below the water table is
called groundwater. What is the source
of this groundwater?
The rainwater and water from other
sources such as rivers and ponds seeps
through the soil and fills the empty
spaces and cracks deep below the
ground. The process of seeping of water
into the ground is called infiltration.
The groundwater thus gets recharged
by this process. At places the
groundwater is stored between layers of
hard rock below the water table. This is
known as an aquifer. Water in the
aquifers can be usually pumped out with
the help of tube wells or handpumps.

construction work is going on? From

where do the workers get water for
construction? May be you have seen
boring being done at such sites to reach
the water table. Enquire from the people
working there how deep they have to dig.
Can we keep on drawing water from
under the ground? How will it affect the
water table?

agricultural activities are some common
factors affecting water table. Scanty
rainfall is another factor that may
deplete the water table. Yet another
factor affecting water table could be
deforestation and decrease in the
effective area for seepage of water.

16.4 DEPLETION OF WATER TABLE

Increasing population creates demand
for construction of houses, shops,
offices, roads and pavements. This
decreases the open areas like parks, and
playgrounds. This, in turn, decreases the
seepage of rainwater into the ground.
What could be the consequence? Recall
that a pukka floor does not allow water
to seep in easily, while in a grass lawn
water seeps through in no time.

no

tt

Water drawn from under the ground gets
replenished by seepage of rainwater. The
water table does not get affected as long
as we draw as much water as is
replenished by natural processes.
However, water table may go down if the
water is not sufficiently replenished.
This may happen due to many reasons.

16.5 DISTRIBUTION

OF

WATER

The distribution of water over the globe
is quite uneven due to a number of
factors.
Some places have good amount of
rain and are water-rich. On the other
hand, there are deserts which have
scanty rainfall.
India is a vast country and the
rainfall is not the same everywhere.
Some regions have excessive rains while
some others have very little rainfall.
Excessive rains cause floods, whereas
the absence of rains results in droughts.
Therefore, some regions in our country
may have floods while others may suffer
from droughts at the same time.

Increasing industries

day by day. This results in depletion of
water table.

ed

Moreover a huge amount of water is
required for construction work. Often
groundwater is used for this purpose.
So, on the one hand we are
consuming more groundwater, and on
the other we are allowing lesser water
to seep into the ground. This results in
depletion of water table. In fact, the
water table in some parts of many cities
has gone down to alarmingly low levels.

Water is used by all the industries.
Almost everything that we use needs
water somewhere in its production
process. The number of industries is
increasing continuously. Water used by
most of the industries is drawn from the
ground.

Activity 16.4

Name some industries familiar to you.
Make a list of the products obtained
from these and used in our daily life.
Discuss with your teacher and parents
how the growing industrial activity is
responsible for the depletion of water
table.

Agricultural activities

no

tt

A majority of farmers in India depend
upon rains for irrigating their crops.
Irrigation systems such as canals are
there only in a few places. Even these
systems may suffer from lack of water
due to erratic rainfall. Therefore, farmers
have to use groundwater for irrigation.
Population pressure on agriculture
forces increasing use of groundwater

rainwater harvesting, about which you
have learnt in Class VI.
Find out if the buildings in your
neighbourhood have water harvesting
systems installed.
We have at many places in India an
age old practice of water storage and
water recharge like the bawris. Bawri
was the traditional way of collecting
water. With time the bawris fell into
disuse and garbage started piling in these
reservoirs. However, because of the acute
water shortage, people in these areas
have had to rethink. The bawris are being
revived. Today the situation is that inspite
of scanty rains these places are
managing their water needs well.
A farmer using water in the field can
also use water economically. Maybe
you have heard of drip irrigation
(Fig. 16.9). Drip irrigation is a technique
of watering plants by making use of
narrow tubings which deliver water
directly at the base of the plant.

provided by a well-planned pipe system.
When the civic authorities supply water
through pipes not all of it may reach
the destination. You might have seen
water supply pipes leaking and a lot of
water gushing out of the pipes. It is
the responsibility of the civic
authorities to prevent such wastage of
precious water.
Mismanagement or wastage may
take place at the level of individuals also.
All of us, knowingly or unknowingly,
waste water while brushing teeth,
shaving, bathing, washing and during
many other activities. Leaking taps is
another source of huge water wastage.
We waste water as though we do not need
water the next time!
We have seen that most of the water
that we get as rainfall just flows away.
This is a waste of precious natural
resource. The rainwater can be used to
recharge the groundwater. This is
referred to as water harvesting or

A case study

no

tt

Bhujpur in the Kutch area of Gujarat has a very erratic rainfall. The only source
of freshwater lies underground because rivers in this area do not have water
throughout the year. Over the years, demand for water has grown. The withdrawal
of groundwater has far exceeded recharge. As a result the water table has gone
down alarmingly.
In 1989, the villagers along with a non-governmental organisation, decided to
harvest rainwater. Eighteen check-dams were built on the Rukmavati river and
its many tributaries. The water so collected increased percolation through the
soil and recharged the aquifers.
According to farmers, the wells have water now and the water that flowed into
the sea and was wasted has become available for irrigation.

WATER: A PRECIOUS RESOURCE

Water-wise habits
1. Turn off taps while
brushing
2. Mop the floor instead of
washing

You must have seen potted plants
wilting and ultimately drying up if they
did not get water even for a few days.
You have already learnt in Chapter 1
that plants need water to get nutrients
from the soil to prepare their food. Just
imagine the consequences if water is not
available to plants!
The green character of the planet
shall be lost. This may mean the end
of all life, for a world without plants
shall mean no food, no oxygen, not
enough rain, and innumerable other

What you have learnt
Water is essential for all living beings. There can be no life without it.



Water exists in three forms: solid, liquid and vapour.



Though water is maintained by the water cycle, yet there is an acute
scarcity of water in many parts of the globe.



There is an uneven distribution of water. Much of it has resulted from
human activities.



Rapid growth of industries, increasing population, growing irrigation
requirements and mismanagement are some of the causes for water
shortage.



We need to be worried about the wastage during the supply of water
through pipes, the leaking taps in buildings and other places.
Unnecessary use of water and overdrawing from groundwater should be
avoided. Recharge of water to the ground should be increased.
